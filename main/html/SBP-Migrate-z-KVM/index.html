            from the operating system. Using the Btrfs file system for the operating system enables
            rollback capabilities when patching the system. The default location for the KVM disk
            images is <code class="filename">/var/lib/libvirt/images/</code>. It is recommended to use
            Logical Volume Manager with the XFS file system for KVM disk images.</p><p>Enabling the firewall is not a requirement but a security decision for each
            organization. Discuss with your organization's security group if to enable the
            firewall.</p><p>For the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Software Selection</span>”</span> in the installer, use the list below for the
