        <span class="italic">Performance States (P-States)</span>.
      Low utilization workloads may use lower P-States to conserve power
      while still achieving acceptable performance. When a CPU is idle,
      lower power idle states <span class="italic">(C-States)</span>
      can be selected to further conserve power. However this comes with
      higher exit latencies when lower power states are selected. It is
      further complicated by the fact that if individual cores are idle and
      running at low power then the additional power can be used to boost
      the performance of active cores. This means this scenario is not a
      straight-forward balance between power consumption and performance.
      More complexity is added on EPYC whereby spare power may be used to
      boost either cores or the Infinity links.</p><p>EPYC provides <span class="italic">SenseMI</span> which,
      among other capabilities, enables CPUs to make adjustments to voltage
      and frequency depending on the historical state of the CPU. There is
      a latency penalty when switching P-States but EPYC is capable of
      fine-grained in the adjustments that can be made to reduce likelihood
      that the latency is a bottleneck. On SUSE Linux Enterprise Server,
      EPYC uses the <span class="command"><strong>acpi_cpufreq</strong></span> driver which allows
      P-states to be configured to match requested performance. However,
      this is limited in terms of the full capabilities of the hardware. It
      cannot boost the frequency beyond the maximum stated frequencies and
      if a target is specified then the highest frequency below the target
      will be used. A special case is if the governor is set to
      performance. In this situation the hardware will quickly use the
      highest available frequency in an attempt to work quickly and then
      return to idle.</p><p>What should be determined is whether power management is likely
      to be a factor for a workload. One that is limited to a subset of
      active CPUs and nodes will have high enough utilization so that power
      management will not be active on those cores and no action is
      required. Hence, with CPU binding, the issue of power management may
      be side-stepped.</p><p>Secondly, a workload that does not communicate heavily with other
      processes and is mostly CPU-bound will also not experience any side
      effects because of power management.</p><p>The workloads that are most likely to be affected are those that
      synchronously communicate between multiple threads or those that idle
      frequently and have low CPU utilization overall. It will be further
      compounded if the threads are sensitive to wakeup latency but there
      are secondary effects if a workload must complete quickly but the CPU
      is running at a low frequency.</p><p>The P-State and C-State of each CPU can be examined using the
        <span class="command"><strong>turbostat</strong></span> utility. The computer output below
      shows an example where one workload is busy on CPU 0 and other
      workloads are idle. A useful exercise is to start a workload and
      monitor the output of <span class="command"><strong>turbostat</strong></span> paying close
      attention to CPUs that have moderate utilization and running at a
      lower frequency. If the workload is latency-sensitive then it is
      grounds for either minimizing the number of CPUs available to the
      workload or configuring power management. </p><pre class="screen">

</pre><p>In the event it is determined that tuning CPU frequency
      management is appropriate. Then the following actions can be taken to
      set the management policy to performance using the
        <span class="command"><strong>cpupower</strong></span> utility:</p><pre class="screen">epyc:~# cpupower frequency-set -g performance
Setting cpu: 0
Setting cpu: 1
Setting cpu: 2
...</pre><p>Persisting it across reboots can be done via a local
        <span class="command"><strong>init</strong></span> script, via <span class="command"><strong>udev</strong></span> or via
      one-shot <span class="command"><strong>systemd</strong></span> service file if it is deemed to
      be necessary. Note that <span class="command"><strong>turbostat</strong></span> will still show
      that idling CPUs use a low frequency. The impact of the policy is
      that the highest P-State will be used as soon as possible when the
      CPU is active. In some cases, a latency bottleneck will occur because
      of a CPU exiting idle. If this is identified on EPYC, restrict the
      C-state by specifying <span class="command"><strong>processor.max_cstate=2</strong></span> on
      the kernel command line which will prevent CPUs from entering lower
      C-states. It is expected on EPYC that the exit latency from C1 is
      very low. But by allowing C2, it reduces interference from the idle
      loop injecting micro-operations into the pipeline and should be the
      best state overall. It is also possible to set the max idle state on
      individual cores using <span class="command"><strong>cpupower idle-set</strong></span>. If SMT
      is enabled, the idle state should be set on both siblings.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="sec-evaluating-workloads.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="sec-security-mitigations.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Evaluating Workloads </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Security Mitigations</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
