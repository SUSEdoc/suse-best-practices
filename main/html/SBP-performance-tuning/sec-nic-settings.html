            features which can enhance the throughput and reduce the
            latency of the networking traffic handled by a compute
            host.</p><p>Use the <span class="bold"><strong>ethtool</strong></span> utility to enable
            and configure these offload capabilities.</p><p>Together with more advanced features, there are other
            capabilities which are common to all NICs and which – for
            example – allow a bigger or smaller buffer to store packets
            received by or transmitted from the NIC itself.</p><p>The next paragraphs will go through the common parameters
            first, and then cover the more advanced features.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-ring-buffers"></a>Ring buffers</h3></div></div></div><p>Each NIC is equipped with memory to store network packets
                received or to be transmitted.</p><p>A bigger buffer allows the NIC to store more packets,
                before issuing an interrupt, thus reducing the number of
                packets dropped at a specific rate.</p><p>It is possible to tune the number of packets to be
                received by the NIC (either read from the network or to be
                transmitted to the network) before triggering an interrupt.
                You can also control how long the NIC should wait after the
                configured amount is received before triggering the
                interrupt. </p><p>For the example at hand, the following values are
                set:</p><pre class="screen">Ethernet Link @ 10Gb/s
Minimum frame size: 84 bytes (worst case scenario)
Packet rate:
       10,000,000,000 b/s / (84 B * 8 b/B) = 14,880,960 packets/s (maximum rate)
       ~14,880 packets/ms (millisecond)
       ~14 packets/us (microsecond)
Interrupt rate: 100us (microseconds)
Receive buffer size required: 1400 entries</pre><p>The <span class="bold"><strong>ethtool</strong></span> option to query
                the value set for the RX (receive) and TX (transmit) ring
                buffer is <span class="bold"><strong>-g</strong></span>. This option
                will show the current configured values and the maximum
                ones allowed by the NIC.</p><p>Example:</p><pre class="screen"># ethtool -g eth1
Ring parameters for eth1:
Pre-set maximums:
RX:		4096
RX Mini:	0
RX Jumbo:	0
TX:		4096
Current hardware settings:
RX:		64
RX Mini:	0
RX Jumbo:	0
TX:		64</pre><p>In the example above you can see that the NIC supports up
                to 4096 entries for both the RX and TX rings, but both
                settings are currently set to 64.</p><p>To modify the values used by the system, use
                    <span class="bold"><strong>ethtool</strong></span> with the <span class="strong"><strong>-G</strong></span> option.</p><p>Example:</p><pre class="screen"># ethtool -G eth1 rx 4096
# ethtool -G eth1 tx 4096
# ethtool -g eth1
Ring parameters for eth1:
Pre-set maximums:
RX:		4096
RX Mini:	0
RX Jumbo:	0
TX:		4096
Current hardware settings:
RX:		4096
RX Mini:	0
RX Jumbo:	0
TX:		4096</pre><p>Increasing the ring buffer sizes to a bigger value allows
                the NIC to receive or send more packets at a given rate,
                thus increasing networking throughput. While increasing the
                ring buffer size has a positive effect on the throughput,
                it has a negative effect on packet latency. This is because
                a packet will stay longer in the NIC memory before being
                processed by the networking stack. </p><p>To not sacrifice latency too much while still increasing
                your network throughput you can use the statistics provided
                by <span class="bold"><strong>ethtool</strong></span> (option <span class="bold"><strong>-S</strong></span>) to balance throughput and
                latency.</p><p>To accomplish this task, start with the default ring size
                for both receive and transmit rings while handling your
                target packets rate (for example 10Gb/s). Then look at
                rx_dropped/tx_dropped counters provided by the
                    <span class="command"><strong>ethtool -S</strong></span> command and increase (by
                a power of 2) the ring buffers until the rx_dropped /
                tx_dropped counters stop or reach the value which is
                considered acceptable for your use case. Note that not all
                scenarios impose a 0-packet-drop requirement.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-interrupt-coalescing"></a>Interrupt Coalescing</h3></div></div></div><p>As mentioned before, NICs also allow configuring:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>how many packets to be queued in the receive
                        (rx-frames) or transmit (tx-frames) ring before
                        triggering an interrupt</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>how long to wait after the value of rx-frames /
                        tx-frames has been reached before triggering an
                        interrupt (rx-usecs/tx-usecs)</p></li></ul></div><p>To fine-tune these parameters you can still use the
                statistics provided by the <span class="command"><strong>ethtool -S</strong></span>
                command.</p><p>However, when higher throughput is required and NAPI is
                being used by the NIC driver, a value of 64 for the
                rx-frames parameter can help to boost throughput, because
                at each poll the driver would consume in polling a maximum
                of 64 packets anyway.</p><p>To configure the above settings use the following
                commands:</p><p>
                <span class="command"><strong># ethtool -C eth1 rx-frames 64</strong></span>
            </p><p>
                <span class="command"><strong># ethtool -C eth1 tx-frames 64</strong></span>

                <span class="command"><strong># ethtool -C eth1 rx-usecs 8</strong></span>
            </p><p>To verify that the new values have been set use the
                following command:</p><p>
                <span class="command"><strong># ethtool -c eth1</strong></span>
            </p><p>To use custom value for the rx-frames/tx-frames and
                rx-usecs/tx-usecs the Dynamic Interrupt Adaptation (DIA)
                needs to be turned off. DIA is the features allowing the
                NIC to auto-tune these settings based on network load. Not
                all NICs implement such a feature; some require a specific
                kernel and driver versions to support it. </p><p>To configure the DIA for both RX and TX use the two
                following commands:</p><p>

                    necessary to be compliant with the MSS and MTU of that
                    network. Any application should be abstracted from the
                    actual network it runs on. This increases portability
                    and ease of maintenance so the kernel takes care of
                    segmenting data into multiple packets before sending it
                    over the network.</p><p>To free up CPU cycles from this duty and allow the
                    kernel to use buffers as big as possible, most NICs
                    implement what is called GSO (Generic Segmentation
                    Offload) and TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload) hence
                    performing the resizing and repackaging by
                    itself.</p><p>To enable or disable GSO or TSO, use the following
                    commands:</p><p>
                    <span class="command"><strong># ethtool -K eth1 gso on</strong></span>
                </p><p>

                    <span class="command"><strong># ethtool -K eth1 tso off</strong></span>
                </p><p>To disable TCP Segmentation Offload, you need to also
                    disable the Generic Segmentation Offload. Otherwise any
                    TCP traffic will be treated as generic.</p><p>On the other hand, you can have TSO enabled while the
                    GSO is disabled. In this case, only TCP traffic will be
                    offloaded to the NIC for segmentation. Any other
                    protocol will be handled (for segmentation) by the
                    Linux kernel networking stack.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sec-receive-offload"></a>Receive Offload</h4></div></div></div><p>To minimize the per packet overhead, the Linux kernel
                    implements what is called Large Receive Offload (LRO)
                    and Generic Receive Offload (GRO). Unfortunately, it
                    has been proved that LRO is broken in some use cases so
                    it is recommended to disable it.</p><p>GRO, however, implements a better technique to merge
                    received packets: the MAC headers must be identical and
                    only a few TCP or IP headers can differ. The set of
                    headers which can differ is severely restricted:
                    checksums are necessarily different, and the IP ID
                    field is allowed to increment. Even the TCP time stamps
                    must be identical, which is less of a restriction than
                    it may seem; the time stamp is a relatively
                    low-resolution field, so it is not uncommon for lots of
                    packets to have the same time stamp. Because of these
                    restrictions, merged packets can be resegmented
                    losslessly. As an added benefit, the GSO code can be
                    used to perform resegmentation. Another important
                    aspect of GRO is that LRO is not limited to TCP/IPv4.
                    GRO was merged since kernel 2.6.29 and is supported by
                    a variety of 10G drivers (see also
                    https://lwn.net/Articles/358910/]</p><p>To enable or disable GRO, use the following
                    commands:</p><p>
                    <span class="command"><strong># ethtool -K eth1 gro on</strong></span>

                    both receive and transmit path. This feature allows
                    adding or stripping a VLAN tag from the packet when
                    received or transmitted.</p><p>By default, most drivers enable this feature but in
                    case it needs to be disabled the commands are:</p><p>
                    <span class="command"><strong># ethtool -K [DEVICE] rxvlan off</strong></span>
                </p><p>
                    <span class="command"><strong># ethtool -K [DEVICE] txvlan off</strong></span>

                    wraps a UDP header around the original packet (for
                    example VxLAN packet) hence adding an additional layer.
                    Because of this extra layer which needs to be added and
                    removed for each packet, the CPU needs to perform more
                    work to simply receive and send each packet. Because
                    the CPU is busy with these <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">new</span>”</span> steps,
                    the throughput and latency of the system for overlay
                    networks is worse than for flat networks.</p><p>Newer NICs implement a tunnel segmentation offload,
                    implementing for an overlay network the same concept
                    available for TCP (TCP Segmentation Offload). </p><p>This feature offloads the segmentation of large
                    transmit packets to NIC hardware. For instance you may
                    have an inner payload of 9000 bytes while you still
                    need to comply with the maximum MTU of 1500. The
                    operation of segmenting the payload in multiple packets
                    (VXLAN encapsulated for instance) is performed by the
                    NIC before transmitting the packet to the
                    network.</p><p>To enable or disable this feature, run the

                </p><p>Another feature which can be found in some NICs is
                    the inner packet checksum offload. When this feature is
                    enabled, it is possible to offload to the hardware the
                    computation of the checksum for the encapsulated
                    packet.</p><p>To enable or disable this feature, run the
                    command:</p><p>
                    <span class="command"><strong># ethtool -K [DEVICE]
                        tx-udp_tnl-csum-segmentation &lt;off&gt;</strong></span>
                </p><p>
                    <span class="command"><strong># ethtool -K [DEVICE]
                        tx-udp_tnl-csum-segmentation &lt;on&gt;</strong></span>
                </p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sec-hashing-offload"></a>Hashing and Packet Steering Offload</h4></div></div></div><p>An important aspect of modern NICs is having
                    multiple hardware queues where packets can be placed
                    either on the receive side or on the transmit
                    side.</p><p>This hardware capability has many advantages in
                    multicore architectures since each queue is also
                    assigned a specific IRQ (see IRQ configuration). In
                    consequence each interrupt can be pinned and handled by
                    a specific core. </p><p>Similarly, the NIC allows you to steer particular
                    flows matching some criteria to a particular hardware
                    queue hence – potentially – steering that flow to a
                    particular CPU core. This is not too far from what RSS
                    does in software but it has the extra advantage of
                    being performed by the hardware. The CPU is freed up
                    from hashing the packets, classifying them and steering
                    them to the right software queue.</p><p>The two <span class="bold"><strong>ethtool</strong></span> parameters
                    which are involved with the hashing and steering of the
                    flows are: <span class="bold"><strong>rxhash</strong></span> and
                        <span class="bold"><strong>ntuple</strong></span>.</p><p>The <span class="bold"><strong>rxhash</strong></span> is a very
                    basic parameter which can be enabled or disabled with
                    the following commands:</p><p>
                    <span class="command"><strong># ethtool -K [DEVICE] rxhash on</strong></span>
                </p><p>
                    <span class="command"><strong># ethtool -K [DEVICE] rxhash off</strong></span>
                </p><p>The <span class="bold"><strong>ntuple</strong></span> parameter
                    is a more complex parameter which allows you to specify
                    the flow you are interested in by configuring the match
                    conditions on various fields of the packet itself. You
                    can find some examples below.</p><p>As an example, to steer the TCP flow from
                    192.168.10.10 to 192.168.10.20 to the queue number 3,
                    run the following command:</p><p>
                    <span class="command"><strong># ethtool -N flow-type tcp4 src-ip
                        192.168.10.10 dst-ip 192.168.10.20 action
                        3</strong></span>
                </p><p>If the value used for the parameter <span class="bold"><strong>action</strong></span> is -1 then the NIC
                    will drop the packet received.</p><p>It is possible to match on various protocols. Some
                    parameters to be configured only apply to some
                    protocols (for example, <span class="italic">proto</span> only applies to <span class="italic">flow-type ether</span> whilst
                        <span class="italic">l4proto</span> only
                    applies to <span class="italic">flow-type
                        ip4</span>). To see a full list of supported
                    parameters and valid values, refer to the
                        <span class="bold"><strong>ethtool</strong></span> manual page (see
