            reached results which were unimaginable a few years ago.
            However, the complexity of modern computer architectures
            requires end users and developers to know how to write code. It
            also requires them to know how to configure and deploy software
            for a specific architecture to get the most out of it.</p><p>This document focuses on fine-tuning a SUSE Linux Enterprise
            system. It covers settings and parameters configurable on SUSE
            Linux Enterprise software offerings, Network Interface Card
            (NIC) settings and some BIOS settings which are common to most
            hardware vendors.</p><p>Performance tuning is hard and general recommendations are
            tricky. This document tries to provide an insight on
            configurations in the Linux kernel which have an impact on the
            overall system performance (throughput versus latency). While
            various settings are described, some examples of potential
            values to be used are provided. However, those values need to
            be considered relatively to the others for the different
            profiles and not necessarily as absolute values to be used. </p><p>This document does not intend to provide a generic
            rule-of-thumb (or values) to be used for performance tuning.
            The finest tuning of those parameters described still requires
            a thorough understanding of the workloads and the hardware they
            run on.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="sec-bios-setup.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> BIOS Setup</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
