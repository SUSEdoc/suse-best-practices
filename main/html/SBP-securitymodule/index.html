One
            of the main attributes valued by enterprises in software is stability. SUSE achieves
            this in a number of ways, one of which is to not change versions of its software
            packages unless there is no other alternative. When SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 became
            generally available in 2009, OpenSSL 0.9.8 was the package included to provide
            encryption for the various other software that used it. </p><p>It was when the requirement for TLS 1.2 came along that a conflict arose between that
            need and the goal of maintaining the same software versions, and hence stability.
            OpenSSL version 0.9.8 simply did not provide an implementation of TLS 1.1 or 1.2 and
            never would provide it. </p><p>In order to provide TLS 1.2 with OpenSSL, SUSE would have to provide version 1.0 or
            higher. Such an update to a more recent OpenSSL version would have been nearly
            impossible, as OpenSSL is notoriously incompatible with itself when moving between
            versions. An OpenSSL version upgrade would trigger a rebuild of a significant number of
            other packages in SUSE Linux Enterprise 11. Subsequently this would require a high
            number of updates to be installed on all our customers' production systems. Worse, a
            version upgrade would break third party applications. This was considered unacceptable,
            so another approach was taken.</p><p>Fortunately, there are cryptographic libraries other than OpenSSL. Amongst those it
            was decided that Mozilla's Network Security Services (<a class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS" target="_top">NSS</a>) would be the best option: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>The library is stable and proven to work, as it provides HTTPS support
                    (including TLS) for the Firefox Web browser. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>An Apache module already exists, which is derived from mod_ssl and thus easy
                    to use for administrators used to mod_ssl. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The NSS library is already part of SUSE Linux Enterprise 11, and support for
                    TLS 1.2 can be provided easily with full backward compatibility.</p></li></ul></div><p>In late November of 2013, SUSE shipped updated versions of libfreebl3, libsoftokn3,
            mozilla-nspr, and mozilla-nss, along with a new package apache2-mod_nss in the
            maintenance channels for SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack (SP) 2 and SP3. While
            this took care of the Web server and Web browser cases, it did not do the same for other
            network services such as e-mail or tools such as wget and curl.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="sec-challenges.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> More Challenges</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
