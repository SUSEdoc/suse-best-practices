                    now have a choice as to which one should be the system-wide default when someone
                    simply enters the <span class="command"><strong>curl</strong></span> command or <span class="command"><strong>wget</strong></span>
                    command. Setting or changing this is accomplished through the use of the SUSE
                    alternatives system (see <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">man 8 update-alternatives</span>”</span> for more
                    information). We will be using the curl package for our examples, but as you
                    would expect, the same can and should be done for the wget package.</p><p>To see which version of curl is the system default, enter the following
                    command:</p><pre class="screen">update-alternatives --display curl</pre><p>You should see output similar to this:</p><pre class="screen"># update-alternatives --display curl

                            <span class="command"><strong>update-alternatives --auto curl </strong></span>command.</p></div><p>Individual users will need to use shell aliases or fully qualified paths to
                    the appropriate command if they want something other than the system

                    or system administrators, <span class="command"><strong>c_rehash</strong></span> and
                        <span class="command"><strong>openssl</strong></span>. The openssl1 package has renamed those two
                    commands to <span class="command"><strong>c_rehash1</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>openssl1</strong></span>. Anyone
                    who wants to be sure they are executing the OpenSSL 1 versions must use the new
                    names explicitly. Note that the <span class="command"><strong>c_rehash1</strong></span> command can
                    generate signatures for both OpenSSL 0.9.8 and OpenSSL 1, but
                        the<span class="command"><strong>c_rehash</strong></span> command cannot.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sec-libldap"></a>libldap-openssl1</h4></div></div></div><p>The libldap-openssl1 package contains commands such as
                        <span class="command"><strong>ldapadd</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>ldapsearch,</strong></span> etc. They are
                    located in <code class="filename">/opt/suse/bin</code> so they will not be used by
                    default. If you want to execute them by default you can either specify the fully
                    qualified path to the commands, modify your PATH environment variable to contain
                        <code class="filename">/opt/suse/bin</code> before <code class="filename">/usr/bin</code>, or
                    create aliases that point to the newer version. </p><p>Some consideration is being given to modifying this package to use the same
                    update-alternatives method as the curl and wget packages. If and when that
                    happens, the commands in <code class="filename">/opt/suse/bin</code> will be moved into a
                    different package, most likely named openldap2-client-openssl1. This will make
                    the contents and naming similar to what is being done now for the OpenSSL 0.9.8
                    package, openldap2-client.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sec-openssh"></a>openssh-openssl1 and postfix-openssl1</h4></div></div></div><p>The OpenSSH and Postfix packages contain both client and server/admin
                    components. Since only one version can be installed at a time, by definition
                    users will not have a choice as to which version they execute.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-serverpack"></a>The Server Packages</h3></div></div></div><p>For OpenSSH and Postfix, the post installation scripts that are executed by RPM
                should set up everything needed in the configuration files and then restart the
                services. If the services were not running at the time the packages were installed,
                they will <span class="italic">not</span> be started automatically. To ensure
                they are running check their status:</p><pre class="screen">service sshd status
service postfix status</pre><p>If either or both are not running, start them:</p><pre class="screen">service sshd start
service postfix start</pre><p>From this point on, there should be no differences from how the services were
                managed previously.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-developmentpack"></a>The Development Packages</h3></div></div></div><p>The two development packages will only be of interest to customers that are doing
                in-house development of C or C++ software that uses these libraries. And they are
                relevant for customers that are installing vendor packages that require all or part
                of their source code to be compiled and linked to these libraries. If the
                corresponding -devel packages from OpenSSL 0.9.8 were never installed on a
                particular system, there should be no need to install the OpenSSL 1.0 versions
                either.</p><p>Because only one set of the development packages can be installed at any one time,
                it is cumbersome to try to do development against both versions on the same system.
                Switching between the two will require uninstalling one version and reinstalling the
                other, as needed.</p><p>Depending on what libraries your OpenSSL 1 application requires, you might need to
                also install one or all of the following packages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>libldap-openssl1-2_4-2</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>cyrus-sasl-openssl1</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>libcurl4-openssl1</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>cyrus-sasl-openssl1-plain</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>cyrus-sasl-openssl1-gssapi</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>cyrus-sasl-openssl1-digestmd5</p></li></ul></div><p>If your application does not require them, then they will only be installed if
                needed by other packages such postfix-openssl1, etc.</p><p>These OpenSSL 1 libraries are located in <code class="filename">/opt/suse/lib64</code> or
                    <code class="filename">/opt/suse/lib</code> on 32-bit systems. This allows them to be
                installed concurrently with the OpenSSL 0.9.8 versions. Because they have exactly
                the same file names as the OpenSSL 0.9.8 libraries in
                    <code class="filename">/usr/lib64</code> and <code class="filename">/usr/lib</code>, it is
                important to make sure that your software build processes are referencing the
                correct versions.</p><p>The way to accomplish this is by telling the compiler/linker where to find the
                desired version. So, when compiling and linking software against OpenSSL 1, pass the
                following parameters to the <span class="command"><strong>gcc</strong></span> command:</p><p>
                <span class="command"><strong>-Wl,-rpath,/opt/suse/lib64</strong></span>
            </p><p>or on 32-bit systems:</p><p>
                <span class="command"><strong>-Wl,-rpath,/opt/suse/lib</strong></span>
            </p><p>This causes both the application and libraries that are built to look for the
                libraries in <code class="filename">/opt/suse/lib64</code> or
                    <code class="filename">/opt/suse/lib</code> first, and in the regular system locations
                later.</p><p>This can most reliably be done by updating whatever <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">make file</span>”</span> is
                being used to build the software. Note that this must be done for any <span class="strong"><strong>libraries</strong></span> being built, as well as binary executables.
                Having a library pointing to the wrong version will be just as wrong as having the
                program being executed pointing to the wrong version.</p><p>When compiling and linking against OpenSSL 0.9.8, you have a choice; either leave
                the <span class="command"><strong>-Wl,-rpath</strong></span> out entirely, or point to
                    <code class="filename">/usr/lib64</code> or on 32-bit systems
                    <code class="filename">/usr/lib</code>.</p><p>To confirm if your software has been built correctly, execute the following
                command against it:</p><pre class="screen">readelf ­a /path/to/your/binaryorlibrary | grep RUNPATH</pre><p>You should see something similar to this example:</p><pre class="screen">readelf -a /usr/lib/postfix/smtp | grep RUNPATH
0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH)            Library runpath: [/opt/suse/lib64]</pre><p>To confirm if your application is not referencing any of the OpenSSL 0.9.8
                libraries, use the <span class="command"><strong>/usr/bin/ldd</strong></span> command as in this
                example:</p><pre class="screen">ldd /usr/lib/postfix/smtp | grep /libssl.so.0
ldd /usr/lib/postfix/smtp | grep /libcrypto.so.0</pre><p>You should not see any output from either of those commands when run against your
                application files. If you do, it means that your application was linked against the
                wrong version of OpenSSL and you need to re-examine your build processes.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="sec-getsoftware.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="sec-appendix.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Getting the Software </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Appendix A</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
