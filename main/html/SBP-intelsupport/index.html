            simple question. But even if the question seems to be simple, there is no simple answer
            to it. For the sake of illustration actual customer questions about a specific Intel
            code named “Haswell” (the Intel E7-4800 v3 CPU), as well as a comparison to some IHV
            implementations (HP* x240 and IBM* 3520 servers) are used in the document at hand. The
            concepts presented here however apply to just about every standard Intel server
            platform, and in principle they apply to desktop and mobile platforms as well. </p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> The Question About Platform Support</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
