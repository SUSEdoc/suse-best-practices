            Server are question about general platform support. For the purpose of the document at
            hand, we formulate them as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Question 1: Which SUSE Linux Enterprise Server releases support Haswell CPUs
                    and chipsets?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Question 2: We see that that HP x240 and IBM x3520 servers utilizing Haswell
                    chipsets have been YES certified. Does this mean that the Intel E7-4800 v3 CPU
                    is also supported?</p></li></ul></div><p>The short answer to these question is: SUSE supports what is YES Certified. Anything
            else should be considered unknown. But looking under the surface, the answer is much
            more complex:</p><p>Haswell is <span class="strong"><strong>not</strong></span> a chipset or a CPU. It is a
            microarchitecture design behind a range of CPUs used in lightweight, low power mobile
            platforms up to highly scalable server systems. The first CPUs and platforms under this
            microarchitecture were released in 2013. Until 2015, a huge number of CPUs had been
            added. They can be (and unfortunately are) all referred to as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Haswell</span>”</span>
            platforms even if they differ in their design and operating system support.</p><p>Since Haswell (and every other Xeon* CPU released by Intel) is backward compatible
            from an instruction set standpoint, theoretically it and other new Intel CPUs can run
            every previous version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. This means that, at from a
            technical or CPU perspective, Haswell can run on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 and any
            older version of it. But, customers do not use CPUs alone; they use complete systems.
            These systems are comprised of other components besides the CPU. Of all these
            components, the CPU itself normally has the least impact on the operating system
            support. In consequence, a statement about Haswell support, or even a specific Intel CPU
            version does not provide valuable information to the customer wanting to know which
            server <span class="strong"><strong>systems</strong></span> are supported with which operating
            system version.</p><p>SUSE only provides support for complete systems that have been validated by SUSE or
            the hardware vendors for use with the particular version of SUSE Linux Enterprise
            server. [^2] </p><p>When a system has been validated as supported for a given major release of SUSE Linux
            Enterprise Server and its Service Packs, it is considered supported for the subsequent
            service packs of that major release. With new major releases currently the hardware must
            be re-validated for supportability. However SUSE strives to make sure recent hardware
            that is supported on previous releases will also be supported on new major releases. It
            is possible that very old hardware will be <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">dropped</span>”</span> from support with very
            new major versions of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.</p><p>In addition, SUSE avoids to make generalized support statements for CPU or CPU
            micro-architectures (for example <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Haswell</span>”</span>) to end users. SUSE includes
            some statements about CPU support in the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server release notes.
            However, these statements are based on new CPUs that were used during development and
            testing of the new SUSE release and are not meant to indicate supportability of any
            particular hardware system. </p><p>The following sections will provide more details about the reasons why SUSE only
            supports validated systems.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="index.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server - Support for Intel Server Platforms </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Full System Validation Counts</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
