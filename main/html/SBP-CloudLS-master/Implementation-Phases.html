questions are discussed and answered. The topics mentioned in chapter 1
must be clarified in this design workshop. If they are not answered properly,
the entire project might be at risk.</p><p>A workshop with SUSE experts takes two to three days and preferably takes place
at the customer’s site. The list of participants should include experts
and architects from all departments involved in the operation and
maintenance of your future cloud environment. This is to ensure proper know-how
is taken in consideration for the design. This should also include members from the
datacenter operations, network operations and storage teams, and from any
application team that runs software in the cloud.</p><p>The most important aspects to be discussed during the design workshop are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Specific business drivers: Why is the customer looking into building a
cloud and what challenge do they want to tackle?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use cases for the cloud: What workloads are running in the cloud
environment and what is the best technical implementation for them?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Implementation: How many environments are required? Is one environment
enough, or are different environments needed, such as a production,
staging, QA, development, or test and trial environment?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Expectations: What are the expectations with regard to the performance
of the cloud in terms of capacity, bandwidth, and latency?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>General conditions: Are there any specific in-house regulations in place
that impact the implementation of a cloud? What are the physical conditions?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Responsibilities: Who drives the project at both ends? Who are the experts
in charge, who communicates to whom during the implementation? Are there any
foreseeable bottlenecks or issues?</p></li></ul></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id-environment-types"></a>Environment Types</h4></div></div></div><p>One important question to clarify is how many OpenStack cloud environments
a customer needs and what purpose they are serving. A production setup
must meet requirements different from a QA or development environment.</p><p>Environments tailored for development are used to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Test new software functionality</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Test configuration changes</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Test patches</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Test temporary product fixes (PTF)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Test upgrade procedures</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Troubleshoot an issue</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Training and sandbox purposes</p></li></ul></div><p>In contrast to a production environment, a development environment only
requires the basic OpenStack services and is easier to set up and maintain.
It is also less complex and better to adapt.</p><p>A QA environment, however, with the purpose to test changes before merging
them into the production platform, must be as close to the production
environment as possible. It has the same level of complexity and
the same operational constraints.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id-the-design-workshop"></a>The Design Workshop</h4></div></div></div><p>Designing the solution is the most challenging part. In previous
chapters, the sizing (number of servers), failure domains and clusters,
networking functionality, and key aspects of the SUSE OpenStack Cloud and
SUSE Enterprise Storage products have been discussed. During the design
phase of the setup, all these factors are combined with the results
of the workshop to create a full picture of what the future cloud
environment will look like.</p><p>In cooperation with the customer, the consultants draft a design
document for the setup and take all mentioned factors into consideration.
They explain how SUSE products such as SUSE Linux Enterprise,
SUSE OpenStack Cloud, SUSE Enterprise Storage, SUSE Manager, and others help
the customer to build a cloud fast and effectively. The design document contains
all relevant information including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Which OpenStack services are to be used?</strong></span> What components in addition to
the basic components are available and are useful in the environment?
What about additions such as OpenStack Monasca?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>How does the design of the network for the cloud look like?</strong></span> What SDN
solution is used? What are the local requirements? How does the physical
layout of the network look like? What is the target size and can the
network handle that size? If not, how does it need to be changed? Are there
any possible showstoppers included in the design such as firewalls? How
does the cloud integrate into the existing structure for (external) networking?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>What network services are required and how will they be rolled out in

critical component of a successful cloud deployment. Ensure your staff
is technically and mentally trained and prepared for the new environment.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id-cpu-and-ram-ratio"></a>CPU and RAM Ratio</h4></div></div></div><p>During the workshop, a technical requirement document is developed. This
document formally defines the type and amount of hardware required for
the cloud environment. Sizing the hardware correctly before ordering it
according to section <a class="xref" href="id-architecture.html#CPU-and-RAM-Ratio">the section called “The Compute Layer”</a> eliminates several problems
that could otherwise arise during the progress of the project.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id-persistent-versus-ephemeral-storage-sizing-rules"></a>Persistent Versus Ephemeral Storage Sizing Rules</h4></div></div></div><p>The difference between persistent and ephemeral storage is important
when sizing the hardware. To understand why ephemeral storage is an intricate
issue, refer to section <a class="xref" href="id-storage.html#Ephemeral-and-Persistent-Storage">the section called “Required Storage Types”</a> and section
<a class="xref" href="id-operating-a-cloud.html#Ephemeral-Issues">the section called “Some Approaches Will Fail”</a> in chapters 2 and 5.</p><p>The sizing for ephemeral storage and persistent storage (which means the storage
available in your Ceph cluster) needs to be determined. It is important to <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
mix up ephemeral disks and persistent block storage in this context. In addition
to the ephemeral disk, which is automatically provided for almost every started VM,
storage for Ceph or any other storage solution must be included in the planning.</p><p>To calculate the minimum disk space needed on a compute node, you need
to determine the highest disk-space-to-RAM ratio from your flavors.</p><p>In the following example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Flavor small: 2 GB RAM, 100 GB ephemeral disk ⇒ 50 GB disk / 1 GB RAM</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Flavor large: 8 GB RAM, 200 GB ephemeral disk ⇒ 25 GB disk / 1 GB RAM</p></li></ul></div><p>50 GB disk / 1 GB RAM is the ratio that matters. If you multiply that
value by the amount of RAM in gigabytes available on a compute node, you
get the minimum disk space required by ephemeral disks. Pad that value
with sufficient space for the root disks plus a buffer to leave some space
for flavors with a higher disk-space-to-RAM ratio in the future.</p><p>After the number of required servers (see section <a class="xref" href="id-architecture.html#Reference-Architecture" title="Reference Architecture">the section called “Reference Architecture”</a>)
is known, it is easy to calculate the required network ports and design the
network switch layout.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id-compatibility-with-suse-linux-enterprise"></a>Compatibility with SUSE Linux Enterprise</h4></div></div></div><p>During the workshop, SUSE experts ensure that the hardware specified in
the list of materials is compatible with the SUSE Linux Enterprise platform
as the foundation of SUSE OpenStack Cloud and SUSE Enterprise Storage.</p><p>More details can be found in the SUSE OpenStack 8 Deployment Guide in the <a class="link" href="https://documentation.suse.com/soc/8/html/suse-openstack-cloud-crowbar-all/cha-depl-req.html#sec-depl-req-hardware" target="_top">Hardware Requirements</a> section.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id-bill-of-material"></a>Bill Of Material</h3></div></div></div><p>Based on the results of the workshop, a list of required hardware and software
components and professional services is compiled. On the basis of this list,
quotes from vendors and suppliers are requested. After having received the
quotes, the solution can be calculated, and the total cost for setting up the
cloud environment can be clarified.</p><p>At this stage of the project, management approval is required to determine whether
the project is pursued further or not. It is also possible to re-design
parts of the solution to decrease its price at the cost of having less functionality
or less capacity available in the setup.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id-hardware-setup"></a>Hardware Setup</h3></div></div></div><p>After the project gets formal management approval, the next logical step
is the acquisition of the required components. When hardware, software
and professional services are delivered, the cloud environment can be built.</p><p>At this stage, customers deploying a SUSE OpenStack Cloud solution receive
a short technical document detailing how to prepare the implementation.
This not only includes the configuration information for the individual
nodes of the setup to ensure a smooth installation of the SUSE OpenStack
Cloud and SUSE Enterprise Storage components, but also information about
any other required component such as autoYaST for the automated deployment
of physical servers.</p><p>The technical document also contains relevant information for staff
from other departments such as datacenter operations or network operations.</p><p>Finally, the server hardware must be set up in the datacenter and
installed with the operating system.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id-deployment"></a>Deployment</h3></div></div></div><p>Using the determined solution for the roll-out of the cloud, the roll-out
is in accordance with the governing factors laid out in the
scope of work definition created together during the design workshop. At
this stage of the project, SUSE architects support the customer
(even on-site) to ensure a quick and good progress of the installation
of your future setup. SUSE supports the customer to make sure to perform the setup
in the right order so that the deployment tools, such as AutoYaST,
are functional from the start and the time required for the deployment
of your cloud is as small as possible.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id-handover"></a>Handover</h3></div></div></div><p>When all components are rolled out as required, formal tests are completed.
As SUSE provides many acceptance tests to choose from, the tests
are based on a catalogue of standard tests. If all tests are completed successfully,
the formal handover of the setup takes place and the responsibility for the
installation is transferred to the customer.</p><p>Depending on the support level included with the subcription for the
solution, you can open support requests and clarify your questions throughout
the validity of your subscription.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id-production"></a>Production</h3></div></div></div><p>After any additional testing is complete, the setup goes into production mode
and starts to actively serve customers.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id-summary"></a>Summary</h3></div></div></div><p>To successfully build up a large scale cloud environment, you should consider
a few factors. Some of them are listed below:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Use Open Standards</strong></span>: Rely on Open Standards and avoid getting locked-in
to a specific vendor. Both objectives are achieved when using open source
software.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Automate</strong></span>: Anything in cloud setups that can be automated should be
automated. This allows your staff to focus on relevant work, such as
developing new features or helping improve the environment.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Scale out — but do it!</strong></span>: The ability to scale out is a key
requirement. Providers mostly scale out when they see the need to remain
competitive. Some companies however do not use the scale-out
capabilities for financial reasons, facing several setbacks.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Get help</strong></span>: Building a large scale cloud environment is an intricate and
difficult task, you need to find the right partners in time and work together
with them to turn the project into a guaranteed success.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="id-operating-a-cloud.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="id-suse-and-the-cloud.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Operating a Cloud </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> SUSE and the Cloud</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
