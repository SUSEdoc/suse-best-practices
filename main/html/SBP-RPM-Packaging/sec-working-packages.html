            tool does not suffice. You will quickly fall into what is commonly called the
            “dependency hell”. This means you download packages manually to quickly satisfy a
            dependency, but then you realize the new package implicates another dependency.</p><p>This problem is taken care of by a tool that implements a solver. The solver
            considers: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>The list of installed packages (and therefore all its dependencies)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The list of available packages</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The user request (<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">install package foo</span>”</span>, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">upgrade
                        system</span>”</span>)</p></li></ul></div><p>The solver performs an operation that finds the best solution to a problem that has
            many solutions. Therefore “best” is defined by policies, user settings, the distribution
            itself, etc. </p><p>On SUSE systems, the solver is implemented by the <span class="strong"><strong>libsolv</strong></span> /&gt; project (see more at <a class="link" href="https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv" target="_top">https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv</a>. This engine implements both a
            satisfiability algorithm and an efficient way to represent the problem in memory.
            Originally it was developed by Michael Schroeder at SUSE, but today it powers also other
            distribution package managers, such as Fedora’s <span class="command"><strong>dnf</strong></span>.</p><p>The rest of the package manager includes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Handling of package repositories</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Checking the integrity of packages</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Fetching remote packages</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Reading and honoring user/system policies</p></li></ul></div><p>In SUSE systems, this functionality is implemented by the <span class="strong"><strong>ZYpp</strong></span> (see <a class="link" href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Libzypp" target="_top">https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Libzypp</a>)library, which also includes a command-line tool called
                <span class="command"><strong>zypper</strong></span>. While tools like <span class="strong"><strong>YaST</strong></span> (see <a class="link" href="https://yast.github.io/" target="_top">https://yast.github.io/</a>) also interact
            with <span class="strong"><strong>ZYpp</strong></span>, on the console you will likely interact
            with <span class="command"><strong>zypper</strong></span>. The command </p><pre class="screen">$ zypper install rsync-3.1.2-1.5.x86_64.rpm</pre><p>will, unlike rpm, check what else your system is missing, retrieve it, and then
            install all the required packages in the right order. It will also warn you if another
            package conflicts with what you are installing, or if the operation has more than one
            solution, and ask you for your decision what to do.</p><p>But from where does the system <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">retrieve other packages</span>”</span>?</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-repositories"></a>Repositories</h3></div></div></div><p>zypper can install a package directly from an rpm file. If there is the need for
                installing dependencies or retrieving packages – for example when you upgrade a
                system - you will need a “library” of packages. This is what is called a repository.
                A repository is:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>A collection of packages</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A set of metadata files</p></li></ul></div><p>The metadata is nothing more than the information present in the rpm file (Name,
                Description, Dependencies). The metadata allows the package manager to operate with
                the repository without having stored all rpm files locally. Every operation that is
                processed uses the given information of the package, and then the rpm files are
                retrieved on demand at installation time.</p><pre class="screen">$ zypper lr

                        architecture-dependent packages (this means ones that contain executables,
                        shared libraries, etc)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>a <code class="filename">noarch</code> directory containing
                        architecture-independent packages (this means ones containing data or
                        scripts)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>a <code class="filename">repodata</code> directory, containing the metadata for all
                        packages </p></li></ul></div><p>The metadata for this type of repositories consists in a
                    <code class="filename">repodata/repomd.xml</code> file index, which is signed
                    (<code class="filename">repomd.xml.asc</code>) using a key already present in the
                original system. <code class="filename">repodata/repomd.xml</code> refers to other metadata
                file with their checksums. The most important file is
                    <code class="filename">primary.xml</code> which contains all package dependencies.</p><p>If you have a directory with rpm packages, you can create the metadata for them
                using the <span class="command"><strong>createrepo</strong></span> tool. After that you can serve that
                repository via HTTP.</p><p>If you have a directory with rpms you want to use as repository, you don’t need to
                add metadata. ZYpp allows to have a plain local directory as a repository, and will
                read the metadata directly from the rpm files into its cache.</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sec-refresh-repo"></a>Refreshing a Repository</h4></div></div></div><p>You can refresh a repository with the command </p><p>
                    <span class="command"><strong>$ zypper ref</strong></span>
                </p><p>While the base repository of the distribution is normally immutable,
                    repositories like the one containing updates often get new content. The purpose
                    of refreshing a repository is to get the up-to-date version of the metadata
                    locally, so that all operations (solving, retrieval) match the current content
                    of the repository.</p><p>If a repository is out of date, it means the local metadata represents a
                    previous version of the repository content. You could try to solve this and
                    fetch packages, but those packages may not exists on the repository anymore, and
                    you will get an error at retrieval time.</p><p>The list of repositories of the system is kept in
                        <code class="filename">/etc/zypp/repos.d</code>. <span class="command"><strong>zypper</strong></span>
                    provides most of repository operations in a safer way than trying to update
                    these files manually.</p><p>During refresh, metadata is cached locally at
                        <code class="filename">/var/cache/zypp/raw</code> and converted to an efficient
                    format for solving operations in <code class="filename">/var/cache/zypp/solv</code>. </p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sec-services"></a>Services</h4></div></div></div><p>Services are a higher-level version of repositories. It is another index that
                    lists repositories. When the system is subscribed to a service, refreshing the
                    service will result in a new list of repositories, and the package manager will
                    add new ones or remove obsolete ones.</p><p>Services are used for example on SUSE Linux Enterprise with the SUSE Customer
                    Center (SCC). A customer is subscribed to a service provided by SCC using proper
                    credentials. The customer, based on his or her entitlements, can “activate” a
                    new product. SUSE Customer Center knows about those activations, and on service
                    refresh, it will provide a new list of repositories that includes the new
                    activated product.</p><p>Services can be installed remote (like SCC), or locally, via a plug-in, on the
                    system. The package manager asks the plug-in for a list of repositories. It is
                    up to the plug-in to build this list. This is normally used for integration with
                    other systems. For example, the connectivity between
                        <span class="command"><strong>zypper</strong></span> and Spacewalk respective SUSE Manager (see
                        <a class="link" href="https://www.suse.com/products/suse-manager/" target="_top">https://www.suse.com/products/suse-manager/</a> was
                    originally implemented using a local plug-in.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sec-repo-sources"></a>Repository sources</h4></div></div></div><p>If you are using SUSE Linux Enterprise, your repositories will appear after
                    the <span class="command"><strong>SUSEConnect</strong></span> tool registers your product against
                    the SUSE Customer Center at <a class="link" href="https://scc.suse.com/login" target="_top">https://scc.suse.com/login</a>.</p><p>If you are using openSUSE, the default installation will set up the base and
                    update the repositories. Additionally, there is a lot of content published by
                    the community on the build service projects or via projects like
                        <span class="command"><strong>packman</strong></span>packman (see <a class="link" href="http://packman.links2linux.org/" target="_top">http://packman.links2linux.org/</a>.</p><p>SUSE Linux Enterprise users can take advantage of the community content via
                    the Package Hub at <a class="link" href="https://packagehub.suse.com/" target="_top">https://packagehub.suse.com/</a>.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-pack-manager-operations"></a>Other Package Manager Operations</h3></div></div></div><p>You can use <span class="command"><strong>zypper lu</strong></span> to list updates, and <span class="command"><strong>zypper
                    up</strong></span> to install them.</p><p>You can lock packages to avoid them being removed or pulled-in using
                    <span class="command"><strong>zypper addlock</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong> zypper removelock</strong></span>. You
                can also list active locks with <span class="command"><strong>zypper locks</strong></span>.</p><p>The distribution upgrade operation <span class="command"><strong>dup</strong></span> is used to do
                destructive upgrades. This means packages may be suggested for removal as
                dependencies like <span class="command"><strong>Obsoletes</strong></span> are taken into account. It is usually
                used to upgrade to major releases or to update rolling distributions like Tumbleweed
                (see <a class="link" href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed" target="_top">https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed</a>. This command
                needs to be used with care.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-other-solvable-types"></a>Other Solvable Types (Products, Patterns, System)</h3></div></div></div><p>The package manager solver loads all available and installed packages and cares
                for solving the dependencies. However, there are other entities similar to packages
                that also have dependencies.</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sec-patterns"></a>Patterns</h4></div></div></div><p>Patterns are used to install a collection of software in a comfortable way.
                    For example you can install a working Laptop-oriented system with the
                    command:</p><pre class="screen">$ zypper install -t pattern laptop</pre><p>But where do patterns come from? They do not exists on their own. The package
                    managers creates them dynamically from packages named patterns-XXXXXX which have
                    a special set of dependencies. Installing a pattern would actually install the
                    package representing that pattern. The other way around is true, if you install
                    the package representing the pattern, it will make the system look like the
                    pattern is installed.</p><p>The command:</p><pre class="screen">$ zypper info --provides patterns-openSUSE-laptop</pre><p>reveals some detail behind patterns (equivalent to <span class="command"><strong>rpm -q --provides
                        patterns-openSUSE-laptop</strong></span>).</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sec-products"></a>Products</h4></div></div></div><p>Similar to patterns, products can be queried with:</p><pre class="screen">$ zypper search -t product</pre><p><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Product</span>”</span> comes from a package called
                        <span class="package">XXXXXX-release</span> which has some special dependencies
                        (<span class="command"><strong>rpm -q --provides openSUSE-release</strong></span>). The release
                    package/product installs some information in
                        <code class="filename">/etc/products.d</code> that is used by other tools get
                    information about the base and add-on products installed.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sec-patches"></a>Patches</h4></div></div></div><p>Patches are used for updates and described by the
                        <code class="filename">updateinfo.xml</code> section of the metadata. They represent
                    an entity that conflicts with older versions of one or more packages. Installing
                    a patch does not install packages, but generates a conflict in the solver that
                    ends with the affected version of packages being upgraded.</p><p>Patches also carry additional property, like the <span class="strong"><strong>CVE</strong></span> (see <a class="link" href="https://cve.mitre.org/" target="_top">https://cve.mitre.org/</a>identifiers
                    of the issues they fix or links to bug tracker incidents.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sec-system"></a>System</h4></div></div></div><p>During solving, there is one entity providing dependencies that is used to
                    match locale and hardware information. If you have a Wi-Fi card, the package
                    manager will dynamically read <code class="filename">/sys/devices</code> and make this
                    entity have provides like: </p><pre class="screen">Provides :modalias(pci:v0000104Cd0000840[01]sv*sd*bc*sc*i*)</pre><p>A package providing a Wi-Fi driver for some cards (for example,
                        <span class="package">wlan-kmp-default</span>), could have the following
                    dependencies:</p><pre class="screen">Supplements: modalias(kernel-default:pci:v0000104Cd0000840[01]sv*sd*bc*sc*i*)

Supplements: modalias(kernel-default:pci:v000010B7d00006000sv*sd*bc*sc*i*)</pre><p>This results in the fact that, at solving time, if the hardware is present,
                    the driver will be selected automatically.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">SUSE SolidDriver Program</h3><p>This is one of the core features of the Kernel Module Packages (KMP)
