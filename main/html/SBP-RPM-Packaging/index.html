A single application is
            distributed as one or more packages. Usually the main package contains the program, and
            in addition some optional or secondary packages.</p><p>On some platforms, applications are self-contained into a directory. This means
            installing an application is simply adding a directory, and uninstalling the application
            is simply removing this directory.</p><p>Linux systems tend to share as much of their components as possible. Partly this is the case
            because of some advantages of this philosophy. But mainly it happens because of the fact
            that in the Linux ecosystem, the whole universe is built by the same entity, except for
            a few 3rd party applications. This makes it easy to assume that a library is available
            for all applications to consume. </p><p>In a MacOS system, only the core comes from a single vendor, and all applications are
            provided by third party suppliers. It is therefore harder to make assumptions, and they
            tend to ship their own version of any depending component, with the exception of

Summary     : Versatile tool for fast incremental file transfer
Description :
Rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file  copying  tool. It can copy
locally, to/from another host over any remote shell, or to/from a remote rsync
daemon. It offers a large number of options that control every aspect of its
behavior and permit very flexible specification of the set of files to be
copied. It is famous for its delta-transfer algorithm, which reduces the amount
of data sent over the network by sending only the differences between the
source files and the existing files in the destination. Rsync is widely used
for backups and mirroring and as an improved copy command for everyday use.

                implemented in higher-level tools like <span class="command"><strong>zypper</strong></span>.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-dependency"></a>Dependency Matching</h3></div></div></div><p>The section <a class="xref" href="index.html#sec-anatomy" title="Anatomy of a Package">the section called “Anatomy of a Package”</a> explains that a package contains a list
                of <span class="command"><strong>Requires</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>Provides</strong></span>. Those are not
                package names, but arbitrary symbols. A package can require or provide any string of
                text. </p><p>The main rule is that each package provides its own name. This means the rsync
                package <span class="command"><strong>Provides: rsync</strong></span>.</p><p>You have also learned that rsync requires <span class="package">/bin/sh</span>. While this
                looks like a file name, in our context it is an arbitrary symbol and the meaning is
                given by the whole distribution. The reason why it does not require a package named
                    <span class="package">sh</span> instead is that it provides a layer of indirection that
                makes the system cohesive. </p><p><span class="package">/bin/sh</span> is a capability provided by the <span class="package">bash</span>
                package. This allows rsync to depend on any shell implementation as long as it
                provides that symbol. </p><p>The distribution build system will scan all executables a package installs in a
                system and inject automatically those <span class="command"><strong>Provides</strong></span>. The packager does
                not need to take care of them.</p><p>The same is done with libraries. As an example, <span class="package">rsync</span> does not
                depend on the <span class="package">glibc</span> package. When <span class="package">glibc</span> was
                built, the build system scanned the content, found
                    <span class="package">/lib64/libc.so.6</span> and injected a <span class="command"><strong>Provides:
                    libc.so.6()(64bit)</strong></span> into the <span class="package">glibc</span> metadata. In the
                case of shared libraries it is not so important where they are located, because the
                linker configuration takes care of that. When the <span class="package">rsync</span> package
                was built (<span class="package">glibc</span> needed to be installed at that point to build
                it), the build system scanned the executable <code class="filename">/usr/lib/rsync</code> and
                realized it was linked against <span class="package">libc.so.6</span>:</p><pre class="screen">$ ldd /usr/bin/rsync

                    <span class="package">musicplayer</span> requires <span class="package">libsound</span>.
                    <code class="filename">/usr/bin/musicplayer</code> links to

                    <span class="package">musicplayer</span> without any issue because it only
                    <span class="command"><strong>Requires: libsound</strong></span> (as in the package name). However, when
                the user tries to run it, he or she gets the following message:</p><pre class="screen">$ musicplayer
error while loading shared libraries: libsound.so.7: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</pre><p>The layer of indirection of automatically injected dependencies prevents this
                manual work from keeping dependencies in synchronization. Packages only provide what
                they really carry (because provides are injected by advanced scanners). Packages
                only require what they really need (because requires are injected by scanning
                executables, scripts for shebangs, etc.).</p><p>This allows rpm based distributions to use these conventions highly cohesive. It
                makes upgrades less problematic and the danger of breaking your system nearly
                non-existent. At the same time, the conventions and indirections between <span class="strong"><strong>Provides</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Requires</strong></span> allow for packages to depend on more abstract capabilities,
                instead of specific package names (which sometimes get renamed, split, obsoleted,
                etc). For example, you can be sure the <span class="package">vim</span> package provides
                    <span class="package">vi</span>.</p><p>There are also other dependencies with more advances purposes:
                    <span class="command"><strong>Conflicts</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>Obsoletes</strong></span>, etc. Their names let
                you easily understand what purposes they have.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-weak-dependencies"></a>Weak Dependencies</h3></div></div></div><p>Not everything is as strict as you might think. Sometimes a package works better
                if another package is present. Sometimes a package enhances the functionality of
                another package, however in neither case they are required. For this purpose,
                packages can have the following dependencies:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>Recommends</strong></span>: a soft version of requires. If the
                        recommended packages are not installed, the package will be installed
                        anyway. Higher level tools however may pull automatically recommended
