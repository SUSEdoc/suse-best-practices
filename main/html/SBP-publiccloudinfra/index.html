   of the IT industry. In many cases Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is
   a leading use case of public cloud. The public cloud brings with it a
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">start and use</span>”</span> expectation. This poses a challenge for an
   Enterprise Linux distribution such as SUSE Linux Enterprise to provide access to the
   update repositories without formal registration of the OS
   installation.</p><p>In a traditional data center a SUSE customer will set up a
   new machine (physical or virtual) and configure the system to connect to
   a local SMT server, be managed by SUSE Manager, or connect to the
   SUSE Customer Center (SCC), for SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 based releases, or to the Novell Customer Center
   (NCC), for SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 based releases to obtain updates. In the public
   cloud the data center workflow is not practical.</p><p>Generating registration entitlements for every instance for use
   with SCC/NCC and providing these to the user would not meet the
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">fire up and use</span>”</span> expectation. Automated generation of
   entitlements and injection into instances, while possible, would provide
   registration with SCC/NCC. But it may generate additional cost for the
   customer as packages would need to be downloaded from outside the cloud
   provider`s network for update purposes. Additionally a direct
   registration of instances with SCC/NCC would put the burden of
   verification concerning eligibility into the SCC/NCC code base. For NCC
   this is not possible and for SCC this is undesirable. Therefore, in a
   public cloud setting it is important that the update infrastructure be
   operated inside the public cloud environment.</p><p>This guide describes the setup of the required infrastructure in
   generic terms that scale from small to large cloud installations. The
   implementation of this setup is a requirement to obtain SUSE Certified
   Cloud Provider status. Additionally this setup can also be implemented
   in a private cloud setup.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="sec-overview.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> High Level Overview</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
