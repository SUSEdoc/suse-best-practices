            secure is one of the biggest ongoing challenges that systems
            administrators can face. Both proprietary and open source
            software companies are constantly at work providing updates
            that fix flaws discovered in their software products.</p><p>Adding to the pressures are the requirements imposed by
            compliance initiatives like PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data
            Security Standard), SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley), HIPAA (Health
            Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), FIPS 140
            (Federal Information Processing Standard), etc. Included in
            most of these <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">standards</span>”</span> are rules that dictate
            the frequency or time frames for patching and often these
            schedules are modified because of the severity level of a
            specific patch.</p><p>Businesses large and small are depending on an ever-changing
            landscape of applications on a wide range of computer
            infrastructure. These can include physical and virtual hosts
            and may have complicated application stacks. These applications
            may have specific kernel version dependencies, have strict
            uptime requirements or be tied to a specific run time
            environment (like Java). They may only be certified on a
            specific Linux OS release, or have a particular set of
            configuration requirements. There might be extra hardening or
            platform requirements that set these hosts apart from the
            rest.</p><p>Additionally, many companies have created duplicate host
            environments like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">development</span>”</span> or
                <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">QA</span>”</span> landscapes that mirror
                <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">production</span>”</span> to allow for testing or
            validation of changes. This means at least one more complete
            set of hosts to manage, patch, and report on. This increases
            the challenges of meeting a rigorous patch schedule that often
            requires patching all hosts on a quarterly basis (or more
            frequently for critical vulnerabilities).</p><p>Is there any way to address all of the issues and regain
            control of a complicated enterprise Linux environment?</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-susesol"></a>A SUSE Solution</h3></div></div></div><p>SUSE Manager delivers best-in-class Linux server
                management features like automated software management,
                system provisioning, and monitoring. It provides a unified
                Linux management infrastructure by standardizing and
                automating server patching and management. These tasks can
                be performed faster and with fewer errors, which improves
                IT staff productivity while reducing server
                downtime.</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sec-defin"></a>Definitions</h4></div></div></div><p>This document uses the word <span class="strong"><strong>landscape</strong></span> to describe one of several
                    groups of Linux hosts. This is commonly used with
                    enterprise software deployments as a way to define the
                    role/quality of a host. Examples include production
                    (PROD), development (DEV), quality assurance (QA), user
                    acceptance/testing (UAT), etc.</p><p>The word <span class="strong"><strong>environment</strong></span> is also used. In this
                    document, environment is defined as a physical
                    separation of Linux hosts, like Corporate (CORP), Store
                    (STORE), or NPE (Non-Production Environment).</p><p>Lastly, the word <span class="strong"><strong>organization</strong></span> is used. SUSE Manager has
                    a concept of organizations and defines them as a
                    separate management environment placed under the
                    default organization that is created during initial
                    installation of a SUSE Manager Server. This is a single
                    parent (like an LDAP <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">O</span>”</span>) with many child
                    placements (like an LDAP <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">OU</span>”</span>–restricted
                    to a flat OU structure with no nesting). Organizations
                    in SUSE Manager will typically have separate
                    credentials required to administer them via the Web
                    UI–and any Linux hosts managed by SUSE Manager will be
                    registered into a single organization and only visible
                    there. Keep these definitions in mind as you
                    read.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-example"></a>Example Scenario</h3></div></div></div><p>The Chameleon Corporation is the world’s largest reptile
                and amphibian pet store, and has its headquarters in Yemen.
                It has more than 1500 stores operating under the names
                LizardsRUs, UnVeiledInc and Chameleo-rama in five different
                countries.</p><p>The Chameleon Corporation has the following requirements
                for managing patch and security updates to their Linux
                hosts. Because of compliance constraints, their patch
                lifecycle (the timing and delivery) is based on their
                corporate security policies, the host
                environments/landscapes, and their future management
                needs.</p><p>Here is a high-level summary of the requirements:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>The published Security Policy states the need to
                        patch all Linux systems with the latest available
                        updates, bug fixes, and enhancements on a quarterly
                        basis. The quarters are defined as Q1: January
                            1<sup>st</sup> through March
                            31<sup>st</sup>, Q2: April
                            1<sup>st</sup> through June
                            30<sup>th</sup>, Q3: July
                            1<sup>st</sup> through
                        September 30<sup>th</sup>, and Q4:
                        October 1<sup>st</sup> through
                        December 31<sup>st</sup>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The published Security Policy also states the
                        need to patch all Linux systems with
                            <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">critical</span>”</span> security updates (CVSS
                        score of 7 or greater) within one month of release
                        of the patch. This introduces a second schedule
                        that may overlap any existing patch roll out.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The company has three different host
                        environments: Corporate, Store, and NPE. These host
                        environments are partitioned using SUSE Manager
                        organizations. Each SUSE Manager organization has
                        visibility into the default SUSE Manager
                        organization’s software channels because of trusts,
                        yet the managed hosts are naturally grouped and
                        managed by their environment.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>There are at least three landscapes in each
                        environment: DEV, UAT, and PROD. There are
                        additional landscapes for some environments (for
                        example, SIT, DIT, etc.) but these are handled
                        similarly to the aforementioned landscapes. Patch
                        lifecycle promotion simply accounts for moving
                        patches into additional stages as needed.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">patch exceptions</span>”</span> process exists,
                        as there is often a need to account for the removal
                        of patches (for example kernel updates) from a
                        rollout. Some hosts might have hardware drivers or
                        third party software that depends on specific
                        kernel versions. This exception process would be
                        handled on a case-by-case basis.</p></li></ol></div><p>In summary, these requirements highlight the need for two
                patch schedules, across three (or more) landscapes, in
                three SUSE Manager organizations, with a way to handle a
                storage location for patches that cannot be rolled out
                (exceptions), yet need to be tracked, re-mediated and
                reintroduced to ensure compliance.</p><p>SUSE Manager can handle these complexities very well and
                can be set up to allow flexible delivery of these
                requirements. Automation can even be applied to assist with
                some facets, and procedures can be developed to ensure the
                consistent delivery of patches that meet the published
                company policies.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-features"></a>Features</h3></div></div></div><p>This document describes how to set up and configure a
                SUSE Manager implementation to enable companies to deliver
                these often requested features:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Automatic creation and archive of patch sets by
                        quarter (or any other time period)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A consistent method of patch promotion and

                requirements, like an increase in, or a reduction of, the
                number of landscapes (DEV and PROD or Sandbox, DEV, QA,
                UAT, PRE-PROD, PROD, etc.), or a more, or less frequent
                delivery calendar. Keep this in mind as you read. SUSE
                Manager is a very flexible product that has helped many
                customers create and deploy solid systems and patch
                management frameworks. Your requirements may differ from
                the ones described here, but the flexibility of SUSE
                Manager enables you to meet your ongoing and changing

                to meet the requirements defined in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scenario</strong></span> section. We will
                start with a description of the architecture (and
                components) developed to meet the requirements, and then
                proceed with steps to create it yourself. Each component
                within this guide is used together with the others to
                deliver a comprehensive solution in the specific scenario
                described herein, but might be used individually to help
                you meet your own solution requirements.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="sec-implement.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Implementation</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
