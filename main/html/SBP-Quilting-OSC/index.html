                <span class="command"><strong>osc</strong></span> is a tool developed to interact with
            OBS servers. It provides many functions including: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Creating, modifying and deleting the information
                    (meta data) about projects and packages and downloading
                    or uploading their code and packaging </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Managing the repositories or targets that projects or
                    packages build against </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preparing and running local builds of packages

                        Requests</span>)</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="command"><strong>quilt</strong></span> is a software utility for managing a
            series of changes to the source code of any computer program.
            Such changes are often called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">patches</span>”</span> or
                <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">patch sets</span>”</span>. <span class="command"><strong>quilt</strong></span> takes
            an arbitrary number of patches and turns them into a single
            patch. In doing so, <span class="command"><strong>quilt</strong></span> makes it easier
            for other programmers to test and evaluate the different
            changes before they are permanently inserted into the source
            code. In short, <span class="command"><strong>quilt</strong></span> allows you to easily
            manage many patches by keeping track of the changes each patch
            makes. Patches can be applied, un-applied, refreshed, and more. </p><p>To understand how <span class="command"><strong>osc</strong></span> and
                <span class="command"><strong>quilt</strong></span> work, a few terms and technologies
            need to be described more in detail:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>OBS manages <span class="italic">repositories</span>, such as <span class="strong"><strong>devel:tools</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>SUSE:SLE-15:GA</strong></span>, or
                        <span class="strong"><strong>home:&lt;username&gt;</strong></span>. <span class="italic">Repositories</span> are sometimes
                    also called <span class="italic">projects</span>. In this documentation, projects
                    are abbreviated as <span class="strong"><strong>PRJ</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A <span class="italic">repository</span>
                    contains a set of <span class="italic">packages</span>, such as <span class="strong"><strong>pam_krb5</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>ntp</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>wget</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>zypper</strong></span>. In this document,
                    packages are abbreviated as <span class="strong"><strong>PKG</strong></span>. Keep in mind that a package can
                    (and usually will) appear in more than one repository,
                    but for all practical purposes each one is a copy in
                    its own right.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A package consists of a set of files, which
                    contains:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>at least a <code class="filename">spec</code>

                            package without any patches applied – possibly
                            accompanied by a <code class="filename">signature</code>
                            file,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>a <code class="filename">changes</code> file,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>possibly a set of <span class="italic"></span>patches which are to be applied in a given
                            sequence, the order being defined by the

                                <code class="filename">rpmlintrc</code> file.</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>While there exists only <span class="strong"><strong>one</strong></span> Open Build Service, it maintains two
            separate collections, or APIs (as they are called in the
            documentation) of repositories:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>the <span class="italic">external</span> build
                    service at <a class="link" href="https://api.opensuse.org" target="_top">https://api.opensuse.org</a>. It can be used by
                    everyone. When you log in to this Web site, you can
                    view all projects available in the external build
                    service. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the <span class="italic">internal</span> build
                    service where the SUSE products are maintained. Only
                    SUSE employees can access this Web site using their log
                    in credentials. Here you can view the existing projects
                    in the internal build service.</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">External Build Service</h3><p>By default, the <span class="command"><strong>osc</strong></span> command works on
                the external build service only. To make it work on the
                internal build service, you need to add the special option
                with argument <code class="option">-A int</code>. As this paper
                focuses on the external API of the Open Build Service, only
                the plain <span class="command"><strong>osc</strong></span> command is used.</p></div><p>This document guides you through the process of modifying a
            package by updating it to a new version, adding an existing
            upstream patch or by building a new patch.</p><p>You might need to add a patch to several versions of the
            respective package in more than one project. The reason is
            that, if you fix a bug, you often need to fix it in various
            SUSE Linux Enterprise releases. For example, if you fix a bug
            in SUSE Linux Enterprise 11, you might also need to fix it in
            SUSE Linux Enterprise 12. For this purpose we will use two
            tools:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>osc</strong></span> to manage the package(s)
                    and</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>quilt</strong></span> to manage the
                    patch(es)</p></li></ul></div><p>Using two tools occasionally requires switching from one tool
            to the other. At the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">junctions</span>”</span>, each of the
            tools will <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">enter the realm</span>”</span> of the other tool.
            But in good Unix tradition, each tool performs its own job,
            while being aware of the other tool. The commands for both
            tools come with a very extensive set of subcommands and very
            good manual pages. Options explained or mentioned in this
            document are usually placed after the subcommand. In
            consequence, for a correct command, type :</p><pre class="screen">osc mbranch -c &lt;PKG&gt;</pre><p>and NOT</p><pre class="screen">osc -c mbranch &lt;PKG&gt;</pre><p>The former command requests to check out files from the
            created branches, while the latter would specify to use an
            alternate configuration file <span class="strong"><strong>
                <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mbranch</span>”</span>
            </strong></span> with <span class="command"><strong>&lt;PKG&gt;</strong></span> as the
            subcommand.</p><p>Both tools come with a built-in help system. To display the
            information for a given subcommand, type:</p><pre class="screen">osc help &lt;subcommand&gt;</pre><p>or</p><pre class="screen">quilt &lt;subcommand&gt; -h</pre></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="sec-repos-projects.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Repositories and Projects</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
