                sources, you must also check if any of the old patches are
                obsoleted by the new version and if they still apply
                without (major) problems. You might hit upon an obsolete or
                faulty patch when one or more patches have been submitted
                and accepted upstream and integrated into the sources.
                Existing patches sometimes do not apply without problems
                when the relevant source sections have changed
                considerably, thus confusing the patching program. Fixing
                issues caused by faulty patches can become an iterative and
                painful process.</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sec-pristine-sources"></a>Pristine Sources</h4></div></div></div><p>As you created a complete set of new sources, the
                    first step should be to replace the old sources by the
                    new ones. Do not forget to remove the old sources to
                    avoid any <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">hiccup</span>”</span> within the build
                    service. You might however want to save the old sources
                    to a subdirectory of your HOME directory for reference
                    and fallback. In addition, if the sources come with a
                    checksum (for example an MD5SUM) or a signature, you
                    should include it.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sec-spec-file"></a>Spec File</h4></div></div></div><p>Modify the spec File to reflect the new release
                    (version, release, source name). First, disable all
                    existing patches, as some of them might be obsolete or
                    have problems being applied (for example if the sources
                    have changed considerably to disrupt the patch
                    program). You can also temporarily move all patches to
                    another directory and bring them back in when
                    required.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sec-build-source-tree"></a>Build the Source Tree</h4></div></div></div><p>Set up the source tree by running the command:</p><pre class="screen">quilt setup &lt;PKG&gt;.spec</pre><p>As there are no patches (yet) available, this command
                    mainly unpacks the TAR archive.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Asterisk Wild Card</h3><p>Often you can use the command <span class="command"><strong>quilt
                            setup *.spec</strong></span> with the asterisk wild
                        card, because usually there is only one spec file.
                        As <span class="command"><strong>quilt setup</strong></span> accepts only a
                        single non-option argument, no damage occurs if
                        more than one spec file exists. However, a warning
                        message is emitted. This means you can redo the
                        command with the desired spec file.</p></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sec-check-patches"></a>Check the Patches</h4></div></div></div><p>Now, one by one, inspect the patches that you removed
                    previously. Determine whether they are still needed. As
                    these are ordinary <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">patch</span>”</span> type patches,
                    you can use the command </p><pre class="screen">patch –dry-run -p1 &lt; &lt;wherever&gt;/patchfile</pre><p>to see if the patch applies well. As some patches
                    were built one directory level deeper, you might need
                    to change to that directory and exchange the
                        <span class="command"><strong>-p1</strong></span> with <span class="command"><strong>-p0</strong></span>. </p><p>If the patch works well, use the command </p><pre class="screen">quilt import &lt;wherever&gt;/patchfile</pre><p>to import the patch and add it to the
                        <code class="filename">series</code> file.</p><p>With the command <span class="command"><strong>quilt push</strong></span> (no
                    further arguments) you actually apply the patch. Add
                    the patch to the spec file, while keeping the original
                    numbering, and continue with <a class="xref" href="sec-build-package.html" title="Build the Package">the section called “Build the Package”</a>. </p><p>If you prefer, you can re-introduce all the patches
                    you removed earlier and build the package subsequently.
                    You can also add one patch at a time and build the
                    package after each addition.</p><p>If a patch is not accepted, you most probably need to
                    re-create it. <a class="xref" href="sec-working-sources.html#sec-patching" title="Patching">the section called “Patching”</a> details
                    how to build a new patch. When you have finished adding
                    all the patches, proceed to <a class="xref" href="sec-build-package.html" title="Build the Package">the section called “Build the Package”</a>.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-patching"></a>Patching</h3></div></div></div><p>The previous paragraphs describe how to update a package
                to a new release or version. But usually, you need to work
                on an existing package and add a patch to fix a bug or
                implement a feature.</p><p>If an upstream patch is already available you can use
                that patch (see <a class="xref" href="sec-working-sources.html#sec-check-patches" title="Check the Patches">the section called “Check the Patches”</a>). This
                can be the case if, for example, you need to fix a security
                vulnerability and someone else has already posted a patch
                for it.</p><p>In other cases, you need to create the patch yourself.
                This can be the case if you</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>cannot apply an existing patch,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>have analyzed a problem and found a fix

                        <span class="italic">package</span>. It now
                    resides in its directory, and consists of the
                        <code class="filename">spec</code> file, the TAR archive,
                    any patches, the <code class="filename">changes</code> file and
                    some additional files.</p><p>The TAR archive contains the <span class="italic">pristine sources</span>. These are the
                    unmodified sources cloned from a Git repository or
                    downloaded from the project’s upstream Web site. Most
                    packages also already come with a set of patches.
                    Extract the source files from the TAR archive and apply
                    these patches first, as specified in the
                        <code class="filename">spec</code> file, before starting to
                    build your own patch. </p><p><span class="command"><strong>Quilt</strong></span> offers subcommands that will
                    do this for you.</p><p>Initialize the source tree from the TAR archive.
                    Unpack the TAR archive and prepare for the application
                    of the <code class="filename">%prep</code>section of the
                        <code class="filename">spec</code> file with the
                    command</p><pre class="screen">quilt setup &lt;packagename&gt;.spec</pre><p>You can also try to use the asterisk wild card
                        <code class="filename">*.spec</code>, but if a package has
                    more than one <code class="filename">spec</code> file, using the
                    wild card does not work. If this is the case,
                        <span class="command"><strong>quilt</strong></span> alerts you.</p><p>While the command <span class="command"><strong>quilt setup</strong></span>
                    prepares the sources, it does not apply the patches. It
                    merely creates a <code class="filename">series</code> file which
                    contains the list of patches from the
                        <code class="filename">spec</code> file in the correct
                    order. To apply the patches, change to the source
                    directory and run the command <span class="command"><strong>quilt push

                    applied to which files, and if everything went smoothly
                    during the application. You are now prepared to add
                    your own patch.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Symbolic Link</h3><p>Occasionally, especially if there are no patches
                        to be applied, you need do create a symbolic link
                        from the source directory to the checkout directory
                        by typing <span class="command"><strong>ln -s ..

                    it. To do so, in the root of the source tree (this is
                    where you just ran the command <span class="command"><strong>quilt push
                        -a</strong></span>), run the command</p><pre class="screen">quilt new &lt;patchname&gt;</pre><p>For a guide on how to name the patch, see the
                    instructions on the openSUSE Web site at <a class="link" href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_Patches_guidelines#Patch_naming" target="_top">https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_Patches_guidelines#Patch_naming</a></p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Name Your Patch</h3><p>Do not forget to name your new patch, else any
                        changes you make will be added to the last
                        patch!</p></div><p>To keep everything under control, you <span class="strong"><strong>must not</strong></span> use your favorite
                    editor to modify a file (although it is perfectly fine
                    to peek into a file using your editor). From the root
                    of the source tree, run the command: </p><pre class="screen">quilt edit dir/file </pre><p>This command does some <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">bookkeeping</span>”</span>;
                    for example it saves the original version of the file.
                    Then it invokes your editor (from the <span class="italic">EDITOR</span> environment
                    variable) on the respective file. Subsequently it adds
                    some more information so that the changes later end up
                    in your patch. </p><p>You can run the command <span class="command"><strong>quilt edit</strong></span>
                    on several files at once: </p><pre class="screen">quilt edit dir1/file1 dir2/file2</pre><p>You can also run <span class="command"><strong>quilt edit</strong></span>
                    multiple times on the same file, reverting and amending
                    previous changes. Only the differences between the
                    original version and the end version are recorded in
                    the patch. The first time you run this command the
                    original file is saved. Each time you leave the editor,
                    the current state of the file is compared to this copy
                    and the patch is created from the differences. If you,
                    for example, make thousands of changes, which, in
                    effect, only change one line, then the patch will
                    contain only the changes to this single line.</p><p>When you build a patch, you should follow these
                    rules:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Make sure you include all required changes in
                            one patch. Do not combine multiple fixes in one
                            patch.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Create multiple patches, if required.</p></li></ol></div><p> This will make it easier to remove a single patch
                    later, for example if the changes are accepted
                    upstream.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sec-including-patch"></a>Including the Patch</h4></div></div></div><p>When you have finished the modifications of the

                        <span class="command"><strong>cd ..</strong></span> and prepare for the
