A single application is
            distributed as one or more packages. Usually the main package contains the program, and
            in addition some optional or secondary packages.</p><p>On some platforms, applications are self-contained into a directory. This means
            installing an application is simply adding a directory, and uninstalling the application
            is simply removing this directory.</p><p>Linux systems tend to share as much of their components as possible. Partly this is the case
            because of some advantages of this philosophy. But mainly it happens because of the fact
            that in the Linux ecosystem, the whole universe is built by the same entity, except for
            a few 3rd party applications. This makes it easy to assume that a library is available
            for all applications to consume. </p><p>In a MacOS system, only the core comes from a single vendor, and all applications are
            provided by third party suppliers. It is therefore harder to make assumptions, and they
            tend to ship their own version of any depending component, with the exception of

Summary     : Versatile tool for fast incremental file transfer
Description :
Rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file  copying  tool. It can copy
locally, to/from another host over any remote shell, or to/from a remote rsync
daemon. It offers a large number of options that control every aspect of its
behavior and permit very flexible specification of the set of files to be
copied. It is famous for its delta-transfer algorithm, which reduces the amount
of data sent over the network by sending only the differences between the
source files and the existing files in the destination. Rsync is widely used
for backups and mirroring and as an improved copy command for everyday use.

                of <span class="command"><strong>Requires</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>Provides</strong></span>. Those are not
                package names, but arbitrary symbols. A package can require or provide any string of
                text. </p><p>The main rule is that each package provides its own name. This means the rsync
                package <span class="command"><strong>Provides: rsync</strong></span>.</p><p>You have also learned that rsync requires <span class="package">/bin/sh</span>. While this
                looks like a file name, in our context it is an arbitrary symbol and the meaning is
                given by the whole distribution. The reason why it does not require a package named
                    <span class="package">sh</span> instead is that it provides a layer of indirection that
                makes the system cohesive. </p><p><span class="package">/bin/sh</span> is a capability provided by the <span class="package">bash</span>
                package. This allows rsync to depend on any shell implementation as long as it
                provides that symbol. </p><p>The distribution build system will scan all executables a package installs in a
                system and inject automatically those <span class="command"><strong>Provides</strong></span>. The packager does
                not need to take care of them.</p><p>The same is done with libraries. As an example, <span class="package">rsync</span> does not
                depend on the <span class="package">glibc</span> package. When <span class="package">glibc</span> was
                built, the build system scanned the content, found
                    <span class="package">/lib64/libc.so.6</span> and injected a <span class="command"><strong>Provides:
                    libc.so.6()(64bit)</strong></span> into the <span class="package">glibc</span> metadata. In the
                case of shared libraries it is not so important where they are located, because the
                linker configuration takes care of that. When the <span class="package">rsync</span> package
                was built (<span class="package">glibc</span> needed to be installed at that point to build
                it), the build system scanned the executable <code class="filename">/usr/lib/rsync</code> and
                realized it was linked against <span class="package">libc.so.6</span>:</p><pre class="screen">$ ldd /usr/bin/rsync

                    <span class="package">musicplayer</span> requires <span class="package">libsound</span>.
                    <code class="filename">/usr/bin/musicplayer</code> links to

                    <span class="package">musicplayer</span> without any issue because it only
                    <span class="command"><strong>Requires: libsound</strong></span> (as in the package name). However, when
                the user tries to run it, he or she gets the following message:</p><pre class="screen">$ musicplayer
error while loading shared libraries: libsound.so.7: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</pre><p>The layer of indirection of automatically injected dependencies prevents this
                manual work from keeping dependencies in synchronization. Packages only provide what
                they really carry (because provides are injected by advanced scanners). Packages
                only require what they really need (because requires are injected by scanning
                executables, scripts for shebangs, etc.).</p><p>This allows rpm based distributions to use these conventions highly cohesive. It
                makes upgrades less problematic and the danger of breaking your system nearly
                non-existent. At the same time, the conventions and indirections between <span class="strong"><strong>Provides</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Requires</strong></span> allow for packages to depend on more abstract capabilities,
                instead of specific package names (which sometimes get renamed, split, obsoleted,
                etc). For example, you can be sure the <span class="package">vim</span> package provides
                    <span class="package">vi</span>.</p><p>There are also other dependencies with more advances purposes:
                    <span class="command"><strong>Conflicts</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>Obsoletes</strong></span>, etc. Their names let
                you easily understand what purposes they have.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-weak-dependencies"></a>Weak Dependencies</h3></div></div></div><p>Not everything is as strict as you might think. Sometimes a package works better
                if another package is present. Sometimes a package enhances the functionality of
                another package, however in neither case they are required. For this purpose,
                packages can have the following dependencies:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>Recommends</strong></span>: a soft version of requires. If the

                        anyway. Higher level tools however may pull automatically recommended
                        packages based on user settings.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The reverse of this dependency is <span class="command"><strong>Supplements</strong></span>. For
                        example a package <span class="package">spellchecker</span> could
                            <span class="command"><strong>Supplements</strong></span> an <span class="package">office-suite</span>

            Originally it was developed by Michael Schroeder at SUSE, but today it powers also other

            install all the required packages in the right order. It will also warn you if another
            package conflicts with what you are installing, or if the operation has more than one

If there is the need for
                installing dependencies or retrieving packages – for example when you upgrade a
                system - you will need a “library” of packages. This is what is called a repository.
                A repository is:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>A collection of packages</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A set of metadata files</p></li></ul></div><p>The metadata is nothing more than the information present in the rpm file (Name,
                Description, Dependencies). The metadata allows the package manager to operate with
                the repository without having stored all rpm files locally. Every operation that is
                processed uses the given information of the package, and then the rpm files are
                retrieved on demand at installation time.</p><pre class="screen">$ zypper lr

                    <code class="filename">repodata/repomd.xml</code> file index, which is signed
                    (<code class="filename">repomd.xml.asc</code>) using a key already present in the
                original system. <code class="filename">repodata/repomd.xml</code> refers to other metadata
                file with their checksums. The most important file is
                    <code class="filename">primary.xml</code> which contains all package dependencies.</p><p>If you have a directory with rpm packages, you can create the metadata for them
                using the <span class="command"><strong>createrepo</strong></span> tool. After that you can serve that
                repository via HTTP.</p><p>If you have a directory with rpms you want to use as repository, you don’t need to
                add metadata. ZYpp allows to have a plain local directory as a repository, and will
                read the metadata directly from the rpm files into its cache.</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sec-refresh-repo"></a>Refreshing a Repository</h4></div></div></div><p>You can refresh a repository with the command </p><p>

                </p><p>While the base repository of the distribution is normally immutable,
                    repositories like the one containing updates often get new content. The purpose
                    of refreshing a repository is to get the up-to-date version of the metadata
                    locally, so that all operations (solving, retrieval) match the current content
                    of the repository.</p><p>If a repository is out of date, it means the local metadata represents a
                    previous version of the repository content. You could try to solve this and
                    fetch packages, but those packages may not exists on the repository anymore, and
                    you will get an error at retrieval time.</p><p>The list of repositories of the system is kept in
                        <code class="filename">/etc/zypp/repos.d</code>. <span class="command"><strong>zypper</strong></span>
                    provides most of repository operations in a safer way than trying to update
                    these files manually.</p><p>During refresh, metadata is cached locally at
                        <code class="filename">/var/cache/zypp/raw</code> and converted to an efficient
                    format for solving operations in <code class="filename">/var/cache/zypp/solv</code>. </p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sec-services"></a>Services</h4></div></div></div><p>Services are a higher-level version of repositories. It is another index that
                    lists repositories. When the system is subscribed to a service, refreshing the
                    service will result in a new list of repositories, and the package manager will
                    add new ones or remove obsolete ones.</p><p>Services are used for example on SUSE Linux Enterprise with the SUSE Customer
                    Center (SCC). A customer is subscribed to a service provided by SCC using proper
                    credentials. The customer, based on his or her entitlements, can “activate” a
                    new product. SUSE Customer Center knows about those activations, and on service
                    refresh, it will provide a new list of repositories that includes the new
                    activated product.</p><p>Services can be installed remote (like SCC), or locally, via a plug-in, on the
                    system. The package manager asks the plug-in for a list of repositories. It is
                    up to the plug-in to build this list. This is normally used for integration with
                    other systems. For example, the connectivity between
                        <span class="command"><strong>zypper</strong></span> and Spacewalk respective SUSE Manager (see

                    update the repositories. Additionally, there is a lot of content published by
                    the community on the build service projects or via projects like

                that also have dependencies.</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sec-patterns"></a>Patterns</h4></div></div></div><p>Patterns are used to install a collection of software in a comfortable way.
                    For example you can install a working Laptop-oriented system with the
                    command:</p><pre class="screen">$ zypper install -t pattern laptop</pre><p>But where do patterns come from? They do not exists on their own. The package
                    managers creates them dynamically from packages named patterns-XXXXXX which have
                    a special set of dependencies. Installing a pattern would actually install the
                    package representing that pattern. The other way around is true, if you install
                    the package representing the pattern, it will make the system look like the

                        (<span class="command"><strong>rpm -q --provides openSUSE-release</strong></span>). The release
                    package/product installs some information in
                        <code class="filename">/etc/products.d</code> that is used by other tools get

                    an entity that conflicts with older versions of one or more packages. Installing
                    a patch does not install packages, but generates a conflict in the solver that

                did end up as content of the package.</p><p>The term <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">building a package</span>”</span> can have two meanings. One is
                assembling the package from existing content. You could build your application in
                Jenkins, take the built artifacts and use the spec file to package it.</p><p>However, where <span class="command"><strong>rpm</strong></span> excels is that you can build the
                application in the spec file itself, and use the distribution and dependencies to
                set up the build environment.</p><p>A common use case to illustrate this is the typical Linux application built with
                    <span class="command"><strong> configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make
                    install</strong></span>. In the next example you build a package for gqlplus (see
                    <a class="link" href="http://gqlplus.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">http://gqlplus.sourceforge.net/</a>, an alternative client for
                Oracle databases.</p><p>Provided that you have readline and ncurses development headers, you can build
                this application by unpacking the TAR archive and performing the commands mentioned
                above. Some programs require an extra step with <span class="command"><strong>autoconf</strong></span> to
                generate the <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span> script. This is specific to building
                software and has nothing to do with packaging.</p><p>When you do <span class="command"><strong>./configure</strong></span> you need to pass the right
                    <span class="command"><strong>--prefix</strong></span>. Macros can help here. You could use the command
                    <span class="command"><strong>configure --prefix=%{_prefix}</strong></span>. However, there is a better
                macro called <span class="strong"><strong>%configure</strong></span> which takes care and sets
                most of the configuration options (You can also try expanding it with <span class="command"><strong>echo
                    $(rpm --eval '%configure')</strong></span>).</p><p>The package cannot build if some libraries are not present. A C compiler is there,
                but the basic build tools (<span class="command"><strong>make</strong></span>) are not available. That
                is what <span class="strong"><strong>BuildRequires</strong></span> are for. They define what
                packages are needed for building - but not necessarily at runtime.</p><p>On the other hand, the original <span class="package">oracle-instantclient-sqlplus</span>
                package is required at runtime, but you do not need it to build your package.</p><pre class="screen">Name:           gqlplus

                    introduction. For the package you are building, you can get an account at the
                        <span class="strong"><strong>openSUSE Build Service</strong></span> instance. Go to
                    your <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Home Project</span>”</span>, and click <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Create New Package</span>”</span>.
                    Upload the spec file and sources. </p><p>After that you need to configure some target distributions for your home
                    project. That can be one base distribution, or another project. This shows the
                    power by allowing building based on layers that can override things from
                    previous layers. </p><p>Add the most popular (open)SUSE distributions (latest Leap and Tumbleweed) and
                    your package will be built automatically. A repository will be published
                    automatically and made available for public consumption. </p><p>Every time the sources change, the package will be rebuilt. If you have more
                    packages in the same project, those will be rebuilt in the right order, and
                    re-published. </p><div class="figure"><a id="fig-rpm-packaging-obs"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1. Open Build Service Overview of Packages</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="90%"><tr><td><img src="images/rpm-packaging-gqlplus-obs.png" width="100%" alt="Open Build Service Overview of Packages" /></td></tr></table></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p>The Open Build Service cannot only build packages, but also images from those

 </p><h5><a id="id1851"></a> 0. PREAMBLE </h5><p>
  The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
  functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure
  everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
  modifying it, either commercially or non-commercially. Secondarily, this
  License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their
  work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by
  others.
 </p><p>
  This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of
  the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the
  GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free
  software.
 </p><p>
  We have designed this License to use it for manuals for free software,
  because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come
  with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this
  License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual
  work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed
  book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
  instruction or reference.
 </p><h5><a id="id1855"></a> 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS </h5><p>
  This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
  under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide,
  royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the
  conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or
  work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You
  accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
  requiring permission under copyright law.
 </p><p>
  A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
  or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
  translated into another language.
 </p><p>
  A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
  Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
  authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
  matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
  subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
  Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be
  a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters,
  or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
  regarding them.
 </p><p>
  The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
  designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
  that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit
  the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as
  Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document
  does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.
 </p><p>
  The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
  Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
  Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5
  words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
 </p><p>
  A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
  represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
  public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with
  generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint
  programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is
  suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a
  variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an
  otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
  been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is
  not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any
  substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
  "Opaque".
 </p><p>
  Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
  without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
  publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or
  PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats
  include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can
  be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
  the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
  machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors
  for output purposes only.
 </p><p>
  The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
  following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
  requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
  any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
  appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
  text.
 </p><p>
  A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title
  either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that
  translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section
  name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
  "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when
  you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ"
  according to this definition.
 </p><p>
  The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states
  that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are
  considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards
  disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers
  may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.
 </p><h5><a id="id1866"></a> 2. VERBATIM COPYING </h5><p>
  You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
  or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and
  the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced
  in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of
  this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
  reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you
  may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large
  enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
 </p><p>
  You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may
  publicly display copies.
 </p><h5><a id="id1869"></a> 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY </h5><p>
  If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed
  covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license
  notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that
  carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the
  front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also
  clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front
  cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
  prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the
  title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as
  verbatim copying in other respects.
 </p><p>
  If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you
  should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
  cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
 </p><p>
  If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
  than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
  with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
  computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
  access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
  Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
  latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
  distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
  copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
  year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through
  your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
 </p><p>
  It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
  Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them
  a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
 </p><h5><a id="id1874"></a> 4. MODIFICATIONS </h5><p>
  You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
  conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
  Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
  role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
  Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
  these things in the Modified Version:
 </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="A"><li class="listitem"><p>
    Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from
    that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
    there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may
    use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that
    version gives permission.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
    together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all
    of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release
    you from this requirement.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,
    as the publisher.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the
    other copyright notices.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving
    the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
    License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and
    required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Include an unaltered copy of this License.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it
    an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
    Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section
    Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
    authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
    an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
    access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
    locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.
    These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network
    location for a work that was published at least four years before the
    Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to
    gives permission.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve the
    Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and
    tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given
    therein.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their
    text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not
    considered part of the section titles.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be
    included in the Modified Version.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to
    conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
   </p></li></ol></div><p>
  If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that
  qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
  Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as
  invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in
  the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any
  other section titles.
 </p><p>
  You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing
  but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,
  statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an
  organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
 </p><p>
  You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
  passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
  Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and
  one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any
  one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
  previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are
  acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
  one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old
  one.
 </p><p>
  The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
  permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
  endorsement of any Modified Version.
 </p><h5><a id="id1911"></a> 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS </h5><p>
  You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
  License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
  provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of
  all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
  Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve
  all their Warranty Disclaimers.
 </p><p>
  The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
  identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are
  multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make
  the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
  parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if
  known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section
  titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
  combined work.
 </p><p>
  In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the
  various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise
  combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled
  "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".
 </p><h5><a id="id1915"></a> 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS </h5><p>
  You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
  released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
  License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the
  collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim
  copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
 </p><p>
  You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
  individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
  into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects
  regarding verbatim copying of that document.
 </p><h5><a id="id1918"></a> 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS </h5><p>
  A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
  independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
  distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from
  the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's
  users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included
  in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the
  aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
 </p><p>
  If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of
  the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
  aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket
  the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if
  the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed
  covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
 </p><h5><a id="id1921"></a> 8. TRANSLATION </h5><p>
  Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
  translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
  Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their
  copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant
  Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
  You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in
  the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
  the original English version of this License and the original versions of
  those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the
  translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
  disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
 </p><p>
  If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
  or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1)
  will typically require changing the actual title.
 </p><h5><a id="id1924"></a> 9. TERMINATION </h5><p>
  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
  expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,
  sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically
  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
  copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 </p><h5><a id="id1926"></a> 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE </h5><p>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
  Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
  similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
  new problems or concerns. See
  <a class="link" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/" target="_top">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.
 </p><p>
  Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the
  Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any
  later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has
  been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
  Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
  any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
 </p><h5><a id="id1930"></a> ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your
  documents </h5><pre class="screen">Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.
