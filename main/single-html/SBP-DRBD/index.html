            and the SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-drbd"></a>About DRBD</h3></div></div></div><p>DRBD is a Linux-kernel block-level replication facility that is widely used as a
                shared-nothing cluster building block. It is included in vanilla kernels since
                2.6.33, and most distributions ship the necessary userspace utilities. Furthermore,
                many distributions have newer DRBD versions than the one included in the kernel in
                extra packages.</p><p>DRBD can replicate across multiple network protocols, and in (currently) three
                modes, from synchronous for local HA clusters, to asynchronous for pushing data to a
                disaster recovery site.</p><p>DRBD is developed and supported worldwide by <a class="link" href="http://www.linbit.com" target="_top">LINBIT</a>. That includes most
                distributions and architectures, with Service Level Agreement (SLA) levels up to
                24/7 e-mail and phone availability.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-sleshae"></a>About SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension</h3></div></div></div><p>SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension is an integrated suite of open
                source clustering technologies that enables you to implement highly available
                physical and virtual Linux clusters, and to eliminate single points of failure. It
                ensures the availability and manageability of critical networked resources including
                data, applications, and services. Thus, it helps you maintain business continuity,
                protect data integrity, and reduce unplanned downtime for your mission-critical
                Linux workloads.</p><p>SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension ships with essential monitoring,
                messaging, and cluster resource management functionality (supporting failover,
                failback, and migration (load balancing) of individually managed cluster
                resources).</p><p>SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension includes DRBD.</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="sec-introduction"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div></div><p>This technical guide describes a setup consisting of two highly available Pacemaker
            clusters in two sites, with a routed IPv4 or IPv6 connection in between. The connection
            can range from a few Mbit/sec up to 10 GBit/sec, depending on the IO load imposed on the
            cluster nodes.</p><p>Various services can be distributed across the clusters. Because of latency between
            the data centers you cannot drive a cluster file system across them. But simply
            replicating the data to have a quick failover in case one site goes down is
            possible.</p><p>Failover between the two sites is managed using the <span class="italic">Booth
                Cluster Ticket Manager</span>, which is included in the Geo Clustering for SUSE
            Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension and the LINBIT HA Cluster Stack. In
            addition to the two cluster sites, a third site is needed to run a booth Arbitrator.
            Arbitrators are single machines that run a booth instance in a special mode. As all
            booth instances communicate with each other, arbitrators help to make more reliable
            decisions about granting or revoking tickets.</p><p>Lots of details will be skimmed. For example, for this technical guide it does not
            matter whether the application driving IO is SAP, an NFS server, a PostgreSQL instance,
            VMs via KVM, Apache, MySQL, or whatever else you may have in use.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="sec-installation"></a>Installation Requirements</h2></div></div></div><p>You need to have the Geo Clustering for SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability
            Extension installed on both pairs of nodes, and on the Arbitrator node. For a detailed
            description on how to configure the geo cluster nodes, see the Geo Clustering Quick
            Start document included in the Geo Clustering for SUSE Linux Enterprise High
            Availability Extension documentation at <a class="link" href="https://documentation.suse.com/sle-ha-geo/12-SP4/single-html/SLE-HA-geo-quick/#art-ha-geo-quick" target="_top">https://documentation.suse.com/sle-ha-geo/12-SP4/single-html/SLE-HA-geo-quick/#art-ha-geo-quick</a>.</p><p>It is good practice and recommended to use LVM as storage layer below DRBD. This
            allows for quick and easy creation and online enlarging of DRBD devices.</p><p>You also need to install all the software including dependencies for the services you
            want to run on all four nodes. In case you replicate Virtual Machines (VMs), these are
            typically self-contained, so you will just need the KVM environment <span class="italic">libvirt</span> with <span class="italic">virsh</span> on
            the cluster nodes.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="sec-architecture"></a>Cluster Architecture Overview</h2></div></div></div><p>The following image depicts a two-site, four-node cluster with arrows showing the
            direction of replication, and blocks in orange showing that a DRBD device is Primary.
            There are two nodes in the local site, <span class="italic">alice</span> and
                <span class="italic">bob</span>, and two nodes in the remote site, <span class="italic">charlie</span> and <span class="italic">daisy</span>.</p><p>Each site will have its own DRBD resource stack and service IP to allow independent
            migration across the cluster nodes.</p><div class="figure"><a id="id1339"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure¬†1.¬†Stacked Four-Node Cluster</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="70%"><tr><td><img src="images/drbd-resource-stacking-4nodes.png" width="100%" alt="Stacked Four-Node Cluster" /></td></tr></table></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p>The most important details of the cluster architecture are the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>The local high availability setup: DRBD running in Protocol C, using IP
                    addresses in a LAN respective a cross-over connection.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Just after activating the lower DRBD devices on one node, the dedicated
                    service IP address is started.</p><p>This is not only used for the service as such, but also as a fixed point that
                    can be accessed by the upper DRBD device (in Secondary state) for
                    replication.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The upper layer DRBD runs on one node per site, and is responsible for
                    replicating the data to the other replication site. This connection runs in
                    protocol A, and might have a DRBD Proxy setup in between.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Data Compression</h3><p>The DRBD Proxy buffers and optionally compresses data, from one or
                        multiple DRBD resources. Compression helps if the site interconnect is
                        slower than the summed average I/O rate of the resources. The ratio is about
                        1:4 for <span class="strong"><strong>zlib</strong></span>, and up to 1:50 for
                            <span class="strong"><strong>lzma</strong></span> compression. See the <span class="quote">‚Äú<span class="quote">DRBD

                    <code class="filename">/etc/drbd.d/nfs.res</code>. This is the recommended configuration,
                because keeping a single file synchronized across the four cluster nodes is easier.

                to perform the basic configuration of the cluster nodes, the DRBD configuration
                files are already included in the list of files to be synchronized.</p><p>To synchronize any changes to the configuration files across both cluster nodes,

            </p><p>If you do not have csync2, or if you do not want to use it, you will need to copy

  Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St,
  Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and
  distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not
  allowed.
 </p><h5><a id="id1340"></a> 0. PREAMBLE </h5><p>
  The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
  functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure
  everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
  modifying it, either commercially or non-commercially. Secondarily, this
  License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their
  work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by
  others.
 </p><p>
  This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of
  the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the
  GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free
  software.
 </p><p>
  We have designed this License to use it for manuals for free software,
  because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come
  with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this
  License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual
  work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed
  book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
  instruction or reference.
 </p><h5><a id="id1341"></a> 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS </h5><p>
  This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
  under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide,
  royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the
  conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or
  work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You
  accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
  requiring permission under copyright law.
 </p><p>
  A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
  or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
  translated into another language.
 </p><p>
  A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
  Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
  authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
  matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
  subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
  Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be
  a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters,
  or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
  regarding them.
 </p><p>
  The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
  designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
  that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit
  the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as
  Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document
  does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.
 </p><p>
  The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
  Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
  Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5
  words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
 </p><p>
  A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
  represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
  public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with
  generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint
  programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is
  suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a
  variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an
  otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
  been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is
  not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any
  substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
  "Opaque".
 </p><p>
  Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
  without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
  publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or
  PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats
  include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can
  be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
  the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
  machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors
  for output purposes only.
 </p><p>
  The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
  following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
  requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
  any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
  appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
  text.
 </p><p>
  A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title
  either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that
  translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section
  name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
  "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when
  you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ"
  according to this definition.
 </p><p>
  The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states
  that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are
  considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards
  disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers
  may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.
 </p><h5><a id="id1342"></a> 2. VERBATIM COPYING </h5><p>
  You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
  or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and
  the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced
  in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of
  this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
  reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you
  may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large
  enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
 </p><p>
  You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may
  publicly display copies.
 </p><h5><a id="id1343"></a> 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY </h5><p>
  If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed
  covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license
  notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that
  carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the
  front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also
  clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front
  cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
  prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the
  title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as
  verbatim copying in other respects.
 </p><p>
  If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you
  should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
  cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
 </p><p>
  If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
  than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
  with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
  computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
  access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
  Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
  latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
  distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
  copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
  year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through
  your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
 </p><p>
  It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
  Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them
  a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
 </p><h5><a id="id1344"></a> 4. MODIFICATIONS </h5><p>
  You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
  conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
  Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
  role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
  Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
  these things in the Modified Version:
 </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="A"><li class="listitem"><p>
    Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from
    that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
    there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may
    use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that
    version gives permission.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
    together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all
    of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release
    you from this requirement.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,
    as the publisher.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the
    other copyright notices.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving
    the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
    License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and
    required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Include an unaltered copy of this License.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it
    an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
    Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section
    Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
    authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
    an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
    access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
    locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.
    These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network
    location for a work that was published at least four years before the
    Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to
    gives permission.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve the
    Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and
    tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given
    therein.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their
    text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not
    considered part of the section titles.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be
    included in the Modified Version.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to

  If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that
  qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
  Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as
  invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in
  the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any
  other section titles.
 </p><p>
  You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing
  but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,
  statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an
  organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
 </p><p>
  You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
  passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
  Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and
  one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any
  one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
  previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are
  acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
  one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old
  one.
 </p><p>
  The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
  permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
  endorsement of any Modified Version.
 </p><h5><a id="id1345"></a> 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS </h5><p>
  You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
  License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
  provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of
  all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
  Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve
  all their Warranty Disclaimers.
 </p><p>
  The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
  identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are
  multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make
  the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
  parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if
  known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section
  titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
  combined work.
 </p><p>
  In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the
  various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise
  combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled
  "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".
 </p><h5><a id="id1346"></a> 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS </h5><p>
  You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
  released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
  License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the
  collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim
  copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
 </p><p>
  You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
  individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
  into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects
  regarding verbatim copying of that document.
 </p><h5><a id="id1347"></a> 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS </h5><p>
  A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
  independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
  distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from
  the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's
  users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included
  in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the
  aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
 </p><p>
  If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of
  the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
  aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket
  the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if
  the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed
  covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
 </p><h5><a id="id1348"></a> 8. TRANSLATION </h5><p>
  Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
  translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
  Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their
  copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant
  Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
  You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in
  the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
  the original English version of this License and the original versions of
  those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the
  translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
  disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
 </p><p>
  If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
  or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1)
  will typically require changing the actual title.
 </p><h5><a id="id1349"></a> 9. TERMINATION </h5><p>
  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
  expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,
  sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically
  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
  copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 </p><h5><a id="id1350"></a> 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE </h5><p>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
  Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
  similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
  new problems or concerns. See
  <a class="link" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/" target="_top">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.
 </p><p>
  Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the
  Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any
  later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has
  been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
  Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
  any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
