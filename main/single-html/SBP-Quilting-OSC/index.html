                <span class="command"><strong>osc</strong></span> is a tool developed to interact with
            OBS servers. It provides many functions including: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Creating, modifying and deleting the information
                    (meta data) about projects and packages and downloading

            series of changes to the source code of any computer program.
            Such changes are often called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">patches</span>”</span> or
                <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">patch sets</span>”</span>. <span class="command"><strong>quilt</strong></span> takes
            an arbitrary number of patches and turns them into a single
            patch. In doing so, <span class="command"><strong>quilt</strong></span> makes it easier
            for other programmers to test and evaluate the different
            changes before they are permanently inserted into the source
            code. In short, <span class="command"><strong>quilt</strong></span> allows you to easily
            manage many patches by keeping track of the changes each patch
            makes. Patches can be applied, un-applied, refreshed, and more. </p><p>To understand how <span class="command"><strong>osc</strong></span> and
                <span class="command"><strong>quilt</strong></span> work, a few terms and technologies
            need to be described more in detail:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>OBS manages <span class="italic">repositories</span>, such as <span class="strong"><strong>devel:tools</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>SUSE:SLE-15:GA</strong></span>, or
                        <span class="strong"><strong>home:&lt;username&gt;</strong></span>. <span class="italic">Repositories</span> are sometimes
                    also called <span class="italic">projects</span>. In this documentation, projects
                    are abbreviated as <span class="strong"><strong>PRJ</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A <span class="italic">repository</span>

In this document,
                    packages are abbreviated as <span class="strong"><strong>PKG</strong></span>. Keep in mind that a package can
                    (and usually will) appear in more than one repository,
                    but for all practical purposes each one is a copy in

            separate collections, or APIs (as they are called in the
            documentation) of repositories:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>the <span class="italic">external</span> build
                    service at <a class="link" href="https://api.opensuse.org" target="_top">https://api.opensuse.org</a>. It can be used by
                    everyone. When you log in to this Web site, you can
                    view all projects available in the external build
                    service. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the <span class="italic">internal</span> build
                    service where the SUSE products are maintained. Only
                    SUSE employees can access this Web site using their log
                    in credentials. Here you can view the existing projects
                    in the internal build service.</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">External Build Service</h3><p>By default, the <span class="command"><strong>osc</strong></span> command works on
                the external build service only. To make it work on the
                internal build service, you need to add the special option
                with argument <code class="option">-A int</code>. As this paper
                focuses on the external API of the Open Build Service, only
                the plain <span class="command"><strong>osc</strong></span> command is used.</p></div><p>This document guides you through the process of modifying a
            package by updating it to a new version, adding an existing
            upstream patch or by building a new patch.</p><p>You might need to add a patch to several versions of the
            respective package in more than one project. The reason is
            that, if you fix a bug, you often need to fix it in various
            SUSE Linux Enterprise releases. For example, if you fix a bug
            in SUSE Linux Enterprise 11, you might also need to fix it in
            SUSE Linux Enterprise 12. For this purpose we will use two
            tools:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>osc</strong></span> to manage the package(s)
                    and</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>quilt</strong></span> to manage the
                    patch(es)</p></li></ul></div><p>Using two tools occasionally requires switching from one tool
            to the other. At the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">junctions</span>”</span>, each of the
            tools will <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">enter the realm</span>”</span> of the other tool.
            But in good Unix tradition, each tool performs its own job,
            while being aware of the other tool. The commands for both
            tools come with a very extensive set of subcommands and very
            good manual pages. Options explained or mentioned in this
            document are usually placed after the subcommand. In
            consequence, for a correct command, type :</p><pre class="screen">osc mbranch -c &lt;PKG&gt;</pre><p>and NOT</p><pre class="screen">osc -c mbranch &lt;PKG&gt;</pre><p>The former command requests to check out files from the
            created branches, while the latter would specify to use an
            alternate configuration file <span class="strong"><strong>
                <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mbranch</span>”</span>
            </strong></span> with <span class="command"><strong>&lt;PKG&gt;</strong></span> as the
            subcommand.</p><p>Both tools come with a built-in help system. To display the
            information for a given subcommand, type:</p><pre class="screen">osc help &lt;subcommand&gt;</pre><p>or</p><pre class="screen">quilt &lt;subcommand&gt; -h</pre></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="sec-repos-projects"></a>Repositories and Projects</h2></div></div></div><p>This chapter focuses on <span class="italic">repositories</span>. You will have to upload packages
            to <span class="italic">repositories</span> and move
            packages from one <span class="italic">repository</span>
            to another. The term <span class="italic">repository</span> is often used as a synonym for
                <span class="italic">project</span>. But strictly
            speaking a <span class="italic">project</span> is a set
            of packages and a <span class="italic">repository</span>
            is the location where the files for these packages are stored. </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Colons</h3><p>When you see colons (<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">:</span>”</span>) in a repository
                (or project) name, notionally replace them by slashes
                    (<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">/</span>”</span>), to make the file name look more
                familiar. </p></div><p>A project can be</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>a software project (for example <span class="strong"><strong>Apache</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Base:System</strong></span>, or <span class="strong"><strong>Linux-PAM</strong></span>)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>a home project (for example <span class="strong"><strong>home:jmoellers</strong></span>) </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>a branch (for example <span class="strong"><strong>home:jmoellers:branches:Linux-PAM</strong></span>)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>a product project (for example <span class="strong"><strong>SUSE:SLE-12-SP3:GA)</strong></span>
                </p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3><p><span class="italic">Product

                        term!</p></div></li></ul></div><p>You can list all projects with the command <span class="command"><strong>osc ls
                /</strong></span>. For the external build service, this command
            returns a rather long list of available projects (at the time
            of writing, almost 45,000 projects were available).</p><p>Each package included in a product usually goes through at
            least three repositories:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>the <span class="italic">development
                        repository</span>, or in short <span class="italic">devel repo</span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                    <span class="italic">Factory</span>

                        repository</span></p></li></ol></div><p>Often a fourth repository is needed, which is the <span class="italic">branch</span> that you create to work on
            the product. In these cases a package passes through the
            following repositories:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>the <span class="italic">development

                    <span class="italic">repository</span> in the
                classical meaning, but usually it is the very basic source
                of a package. It could be a Git repository that you clone,
                or a Web site from where you download a TAR archive. </p><p>When you fix a bug, you should submit the patch to
                    <span class="emphasis">upstream</span> to ensure it can
                be included into future versions of the package. This has
                the advantage that next time you upgrade the package from
                    <span class="italic">upstream</span>, you might
                be able to drop one or more local patches. In addition, you
                contribute your efforts to the community. However, getting
                the patch accepted might require some patience and
                persistence, because some upstream maintainers have very
                special requirements regarding how to fix a bug. But
                usually most <span class="italic">upstream</span>
                maintainers are grateful for any fixes.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-dev-repo"></a>Development Repository</h3></div></div></div><p>The <span class="italic">development

                the rolling development code base for the openSUSE
                distribution Tumbleweed. <span class="italic">Factory</span> is mainly used as an internal term
                for openSUSE's distribution developers, and the target
                project for all contributions to openSUSE's main code base.
                There is a constant flow of packages going into <span class="italic">Factory</span>. There is no package
                or feature freeze; therefore, the <span class="italic">Factory</span> repository is not guaranteed to be
                fully stable and is not intended to be used as a
                distribution itself.</p><p>The core system packages receive automated testing via
                openQA, the automated test tool for Linux operating systems
                (for more information, see <a class="link" href="http://open.qa/" target="_top">http://open.qa/</a>).
                When automated testing is completed and the repository is
                in a consistent state, it is synchronized to the download
                mirrors. Then it is published as the openSUSE Tumbleweed
                distribution, the rolling release version of the openSUSE
                project, featuring the newest technology (see <a class="link" href="https://www.opensuse.org/#Tumbleweed" target="_top">https://www.opensuse.org/#Tumbleweed</a>). It is of
                course also the basis for openSUSE Leap, the regular annual
                release from the openSUSE project, with security and
                stability being the main focus. </p><p>In addition, <span class="italic">Factory</span>
                is used as the base repository containing the code stream
                for the development of the next major version of SUSE Linux
                Enterprise and all related enterprise-class products.
                Therefore it is all the more important to keep this

                    projects, and is not regulated or controlled by SUSE.
                    Package maintainers are usually members of the openSUSE

                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Factory First</span>”</span>
                </strong></span>. In theory, this means that you need to submit
                any package that you want to see included in any version of
                openSUSE or SUSE Linux Enterprise to <span class="italic">Factory</span>. In practice, you will
                submit your package or patch to the <span class="italic">devel repo</span> first and then you will submit
                to <span class="italic">Factory</span> from there.
                As you branch and check out from the <span class="italic">devel repo</span>,
                    <span class="command"><strong>osc</strong></span> will automatically submit

                repositories containing the packages that are bundled into
                a SUSE product. When a new product is built, its repository
                usually is named <span class="strong"><strong>SUSE:&lt;productname&gt;:GA</strong></span> (for example
                    <span class="strong"><strong>SUSE:SLE-15:GA</strong></span>). At
                a later stage of the lifecycle, after the General
                Availability (GA) of the product, when the service packs
                for a product need to be created, a repository <span class="strong"><strong>SUSE:&lt;productname&gt;:Update</strong></span> is set up.
                This is the repository to which you now should submit your
                patches. The next service pack of a product will be built
                from this repository.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">GA Production Repository</h3><p>You cannot directly submit to the GA production

                        <span class="italic">Factory</span>. Then
                    the product release team will fetch the package from
                    there. You can, however, submit to the <span class="strong"><strong>Update</strong></span> repositories when

                (after which you submit the patch to <span class="strong"><strong>openSUSE:Factory</strong></span>), you may

                and accepted upstream and integrated into the sources.
                Existing patches sometimes do not apply without problems
                when the relevant source sections have changed
                considerably, thus confusing the patching program. Fixing

                    to a subdirectory of your HOME directory for reference
                    and fallback. In addition, if the sources come with a
                    checksum (for example an MD5SUM) or a signature, you
                    should include it.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sec-spec-file"></a>Spec File</h4></div></div></div><p>Modify the spec File to reflect the new release

                    editor to modify a file (although it is perfectly fine
                    to peek into a file using your editor). From the root

                    for example it saves the original version of the file.
                    Then it invokes your editor (from the <span class="italic">EDITOR</span> environment
                    variable) on the respective file. Subsequently it adds
                    some more information so that the changes later end up
                    in your patch. </p><p>You can run the command <span class="command"><strong>quilt edit</strong></span>
                    on several files at once: </p><pre class="screen">quilt edit dir1/file1 dir2/file2</pre><p>You can also run <span class="command"><strong>quilt edit</strong></span>
                    multiple times on the same file, reverting and amending
                    previous changes. Only the differences between the
                    original version and the end version are recorded in
                    the patch. The first time you run this command the
                    original file is saved. Each time you leave the editor,
                    the current state of the file is compared to this copy
                    and the patch is created from the differences. If you,
                    for example, make thousands of changes, which, in
                    effect, only change one line, then the patch will
                    contain only the changes to this single line.</p><p>When you build a patch, you should follow these

            repository.</p><p>A useful technique to do so is to start at one end of the
            sequence of releases. This could be the oldest or the newest
            release, for example the version in the <span class="italic">devel repo</span>. Now work your way down to the other
            end, to the newest or the oldest release. At the start end, you
            build the patch and test it. Then you change to the next (newer
            or older) package instance and use the patch from the previous
            step as the basis (use <span class="command"><strong>patch –-dry-run</strong></span>,
                <span class="command"><strong>quilt import</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>quilt
                push</strong></span>). In theory this approach assumes that, at
            each step, the package will not have changed much so the patch
            from the previous step can be applied, albeit with some
            correction. Sometimes this does not work; then you need to
            re-write the patch from scratch. But usually this method works,
            saves some time and prevents errors.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="sec-conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div></div><p>In summary, the tasks you usually perform to modify a package

  Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St,
  Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and
  distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not
  allowed.
 </p><h5><a id="id2225"></a> 0. PREAMBLE </h5><p>
  The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
  functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure
  everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
  modifying it, either commercially or non-commercially. Secondarily, this
  License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their
  work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by
  others.
 </p><p>
  This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of
  the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the
  GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free
  software.
 </p><p>
  We have designed this License to use it for manuals for free software,
  because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come
  with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this
  License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual
  work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed
  book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
  instruction or reference.
 </p><h5><a id="id2229"></a> 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS </h5><p>
  This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
  under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide,
  royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the
  conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or
  work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You
  accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
  requiring permission under copyright law.
 </p><p>
  A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
  or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
  translated into another language.
 </p><p>
  A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
  Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
  authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
  matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
  subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
  Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be
  a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters,
  or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
  regarding them.
 </p><p>
  The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
  designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
  that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit
  the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as
  Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document
  does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.
 </p><p>
  The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
  Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
  Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5
  words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
 </p><p>
  A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
  represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
  public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with
  generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint
  programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is
  suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a
  variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an
  otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
  been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is
  not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any
  substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
  "Opaque".
 </p><p>
  Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
  without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
  publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or
  PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats
  include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can
  be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
  the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
  machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors
  for output purposes only.
 </p><p>
  The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
  following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
  requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
  any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
  appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
  text.
 </p><p>
  A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title
  either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that
  translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section
  name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
  "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when
  you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ"
  according to this definition.
 </p><p>
  The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states
  that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are
  considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards
  disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers
  may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.
 </p><h5><a id="id2240"></a> 2. VERBATIM COPYING </h5><p>
  You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
  or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and
  the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced
  in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of
  this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
  reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you
  may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large
  enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
 </p><p>
  You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may
  publicly display copies.
 </p><h5><a id="id2243"></a> 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY </h5><p>
  If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed
  covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license
  notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that
  carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the
  front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also
  clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front
  cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
  prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the
  title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as
  verbatim copying in other respects.
 </p><p>
  If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you
  should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
  cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
 </p><p>
  If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
  than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
  with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
  computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
  access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
  Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
  latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
  distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
  copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
  year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through
  your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
 </p><p>
  It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
  Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them
  a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
 </p><h5><a id="id2248"></a> 4. MODIFICATIONS </h5><p>
  You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
  conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
  Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
  role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
  Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
  these things in the Modified Version:
 </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="A"><li class="listitem"><p>
    Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from
    that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
    there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may
    use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that
    version gives permission.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
    together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all
    of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release
    you from this requirement.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,
    as the publisher.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the
    other copyright notices.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving
    the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
    License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and
    required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Include an unaltered copy of this License.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it
    an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
    Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section
    Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
    authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
    an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
    access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
    locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.
    These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network
    location for a work that was published at least four years before the
    Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to
    gives permission.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve the
    Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and
    tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given
    therein.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their
    text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not
    considered part of the section titles.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be
    included in the Modified Version.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to
    conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
   </p></li></ol></div><p>
  If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that
  qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
  Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as
  invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in
  the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any
  other section titles.
 </p><p>
  You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing
  but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,
  statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an
  organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
 </p><p>
  You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
  passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
  Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and
  one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any
  one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
  previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are
  acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
  one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old
  one.
 </p><p>
  The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
  permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
  endorsement of any Modified Version.
 </p><h5><a id="id2285"></a> 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS </h5><p>
  You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
  License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
  provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of
  all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
  Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve
  all their Warranty Disclaimers.
 </p><p>
  The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
  identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are
  multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make
  the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
  parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if
  known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section
  titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
  combined work.
 </p><p>
  In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the
  various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise
  combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled
  "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".
 </p><h5><a id="id2289"></a> 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS </h5><p>
  You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
  released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
  License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the
  collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim
  copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
 </p><p>
  You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
  individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
  into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects
  regarding verbatim copying of that document.
 </p><h5><a id="id2292"></a> 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS </h5><p>
  A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
  independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
  distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from
  the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's
  users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included
  in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the
  aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
 </p><p>
  If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of
  the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
  aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket
  the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if
  the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed
  covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
 </p><h5><a id="id2295"></a> 8. TRANSLATION </h5><p>
  Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
  translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
  Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their
  copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant
  Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
  You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in
  the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
  the original English version of this License and the original versions of
  those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the
  translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
  disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
 </p><p>
  If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
  or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1)
  will typically require changing the actual title.
 </p><h5><a id="id2298"></a> 9. TERMINATION </h5><p>
  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
  expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,
  sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically
  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
  copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 </p><h5><a id="id2300"></a> 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE </h5><p>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
  Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
  similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
  new problems or concerns. See
  <a class="link" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/" target="_top">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.
 </p><p>
  Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the
  Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any
  later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has
  been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
  Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
  any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
 </p><h5><a id="id2304"></a> ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your
  documents </h5><pre class="screen">Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.
Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
 Free Documentation License".</pre><p>
  If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
  replace the "with...Texts". line with this:
 </p><pre class="screen">with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.</pre><p>
  If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination
  of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.
 </p><p>
  If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend
  releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software
  license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free
  software.
