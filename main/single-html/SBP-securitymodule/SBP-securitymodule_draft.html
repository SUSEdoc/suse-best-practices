One
            of the main attributes valued by enterprises in software is stability. SUSE achieves
            this in a number of ways, one of which is to not change versions of its software
            packages unless there is no other alternative. When SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 became
            generally available in 2009, OpenSSL 0.9.8 was the package included to provide
            encryption for the various other software that used it. </p><p>It was when the requirement for TLS 1.2 came along that a conflict arose between that
            need and the goal of maintaining the same software versions, and hence stability.
            OpenSSL version 0.9.8 simply did not provide an implementation of TLS 1.1 or 1.2 and
            never would provide it. </p><p>In order to provide TLS 1.2 with OpenSSL, SUSE would have to provide version 1.0 or
            higher. Such an update to a more recent OpenSSL version would have been nearly
            impossible, as OpenSSL is notoriously incompatible with itself when moving between
            versions. An OpenSSL version upgrade would trigger a rebuild of a significant number of
            other packages in SUSE Linux Enterprise 11. Subsequently this would require a high
            number of updates to be installed on all our customers' production systems. Worse, a
            version upgrade would break third party applications. This was considered unacceptable,
            so another approach was taken.</p><p>Fortunately, there are cryptographic libraries other than OpenSSL. Amongst those it
            was decided that Mozilla's Network Security Services (<a class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS" target="_top">NSS</a>) would be the best option: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>The library is stable and proven to work, as it provides HTTPS support
                    (including TLS) for the Firefox Web browser. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>An Apache module already exists, which is derived from mod_ssl and thus easy
                    to use for administrators used to mod_ssl. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The NSS library is already part of SUSE Linux Enterprise 11, and support for
                    TLS 1.2 can be provided easily with full backward compatibility.</p></li></ul></div><p>In late November of 2013, SUSE shipped updated versions of libfreebl3, libsoftokn3,
            mozilla-nspr, and mozilla-nss, along with a new package apache2-mod_nss in the
            maintenance channels for SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack (SP) 2 and SP3. While
            this took care of the Web server and Web browser cases, it did not do the same for other
            network services such as e-mail or tools such as wget and curl.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="sec-challenges"></a>More Challenges</h2></div></div></div><p>The e-mail server that is included with SUSE Linux Enterprise, Postfix, does not work
            with NSS, only with OpenSSL. Simply shipping both OpenSSL 0.9.8 and OpenSSL 1.0 was not
            an option because it was all too likely that customers would install both versions of
            OpenSSL on their systems. Because of the incompatibilities discussed earlier, this would
            almost certainly have led to all sorts of application crashes. </p><p> The lack of SUSE provided packages built against OpenSSL 1.0 lead to some customers
            attempting to recompile them from source, with mixed success. Worse, the recompiled
            packages were not supported by SUSE and could affect the supportability for the entire
            system. Further, customers would need some way of rebuilding their in-house written
            applications against OpenSSL 1.0 to be compliant. Clearly something more was
            needed.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="sec-roundtwo"></a>Round Two</h2></div></div></div><p>In August of 2014, SUSE released the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Security
                Module</span>”</span>, providing enhancements to SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP3, and later
            SP4. Available to all customers with a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server subscription, this
            allows customers and partners to build TLS 1.2 compliant infrastructures beyond the
            HTTPS protocol. The packages in the Security Module will be supported in the same way
            and for the same period of time as the other packages shipped with SUSE Linux Enterprise
            11 (see <a class="link" href="https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/" target="_top">https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/</a>). </p><p> In this context the term <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">module</span>”</span> can be somewhat confusing but it comes
            from the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">optional modules</span>”</span> that were introduced with SUSE Linux Enterprise
            12 (see <a class="link" href="https://www.suse.com/products/server/features/modules.html" target="_top">https://www.suse.com/products/server/features/modules.html</a>). Essentially the Security Module is an additional package and maintenance repository
            for use by YaST or Zypper. There are no DVDs to order or ISO images to download. At this
            time, there are a total of 31 packages available in the Security Module:</p><table border="0" summary="Simple list" class="simplelist"><tr><td>curl-openssl1</td></tr><tr><td>cyrus-sasl-openssl1</td></tr><tr><td>cyrus-sasl-openssl1-32bit</td></tr><tr><td>cyrus-sasl-openssl1-crammd5</td></tr><tr><td>cyrus-sasl-openssl1-digestmd5</td></tr><tr><td>cyrus-sasl-openssl1-gssapi</td></tr><tr><td>cyrus-sasl-openssl1-ntlm</td></tr><tr><td>cyrus-sasl-openssl1-otp</td></tr><tr><td>cyrus-sasl-openssl1-plain</td></tr><tr><td>libcurl4-openssl1</td></tr><tr><td>libcurl4-openssl1-32bit</td></tr><tr><td>libldap-openssl1-2_4-2</td></tr><tr><td>libldap-openssl1-2_4-2-32bit</td></tr><tr><td>libopenssl1_0_0</td></tr><tr><td>libopenssl1_0_0-32bit</td></tr><tr><td>libopenssl1-devel</td></tr><tr><td>openldap2-client-openssl1</td></tr><tr><td>openssh-openssl1</td></tr><tr><td>openssh-openssl1-helpers</td></tr><tr><td>openssl1</td></tr><tr><td>openssl1-doc</td></tr><tr><td>openvpn-openssl1</td></tr><tr><td>openvpn-openssl1-down-root-plugin</td></tr><tr><td>perl-Crypt-SSLeay-openssl1</td></tr><tr><td>perl-Net-SSLeay-openssl1</td></tr><tr><td>postfix-openssl1</td></tr><tr><td>postfix-openssl1-devel</td></tr><tr><td>postfix-openssl1-doc</td></tr><tr><td>postfix-openssl1-mysql</td></tr><tr><td>postfix-openssl1-postgresql</td></tr><tr><td>stunnel</td></tr><tr><td>wget-openssl1openssh-openssl1-helpers</td></tr></table><p>As you can see there are packages containing executables, runtime libraries, and
            development files. They are also named to be easily distinguishable from the versions
            built against OpenSSL 0.9.8. With a few exceptions, the OpenSSL 1.0 packages <span class="bold"><strong>may</strong></span> be installed concurrently with the versions using OpenSSL
            0.9.8. Those exceptions that may not be installed concurrently are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>libopenssl1-devel</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>openssh-openssl1</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>openssl1-doc</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>perl-Crypt-SSLeay-openssl1</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>perl-Net-SSLeay-openssl1</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>postfix-openssl1</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>postfix-openssl1-devel</p></li></ul></div><p>For the OpenSSH and Postfix packages, it does not make sense to have more than one
            version installed since they provide a service for the entire system, not just for one
            user or application. For the Perl and -devel packages a conflict is unavoidable as the
            header and .so files are in the same locations. This means that only the OpenSSL 0.9.8
            or the OpenSSL 1.0 version of these packages may be installed on a given system at one
            time.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="sec-getsoftware"></a>Getting the Software</h2></div></div></div><p>Since all the packages reside in a single repository or maintenance channel, there are
            just two major steps that need to be taken first:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Verify or get access to the Security Module. See Appendix A for the gory

                automatically change any other existing applications to use OpenSSL 1. Unless ported
                or rebuilt by the vendor they will still use the OpenSSL 0.9.8 libraries. For C or
                C++ applications developed in-house you will need to build OpenSSL 1 versions as
                described in the section on how to use the development packages.</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="sec-usingpack"></a>Using the Packages</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-interactpack"></a>The Interactive Packages</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="sec-curlwget"></a>curl-openssl1 and wget-openssl1</h4></div></div></div><p>If you have chosen to install the curl-openssl1 or wget-openssl1 packages, you

                    command. Setting or changing this is accomplished through the use of the SUSE
                    alternatives system (see <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">man 8 update-alternatives</span>”</span> for more
                    information). We will be using the curl package for our examples, but as you
                    would expect, the same can and should be done for the wget package.</p><p>To see which version of curl is the system default, enter the following
                    command:</p><pre class="screen">update-alternatives --display curl</pre><p>You should see output similar to this:</p><pre class="screen"># update-alternatives --display curl

                relevant for customers that are installing vendor packages that require all or part
                of their source code to be compiled and linked to these libraries. If the
                corresponding -devel packages from OpenSSL 0.9.8 were never installed on a

                it is cumbersome to try to do development against both versions on the same system.
                Switching between the two will require uninstalling one version and reinstalling the
                other, as needed.</p><p>Depending on what libraries your OpenSSL 1 application requires, you might need to
                also install one or all of the following packages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>libldap-openssl1-2_4-2</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>cyrus-sasl-openssl1</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>libcurl4-openssl1</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>cyrus-sasl-openssl1-plain</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>cyrus-sasl-openssl1-gssapi</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>cyrus-sasl-openssl1-digestmd5</p></li></ul></div><p>If your application does not require them, then they will only be installed if
                needed by other packages such postfix-openssl1, etc.</p><p>These OpenSSL 1 libraries are located in <code class="filename">/opt/suse/lib64</code> or
                    <code class="filename">/opt/suse/lib</code> on 32-bit systems. This allows them to be
                installed concurrently with the OpenSSL 0.9.8 versions. Because they have exactly
                the same file names as the OpenSSL 0.9.8 libraries in
                    <code class="filename">/usr/lib64</code> and <code class="filename">/usr/lib</code>, it is
                important to make sure that your software build processes are referencing the
                correct versions.</p><p>The way to accomplish this is by telling the compiler/linker where to find the
                desired version. So, when compiling and linking software against OpenSSL 1, pass the
                following parameters to the <span class="command"><strong>gcc</strong></span> command:</p><p>
                <span class="command"><strong>-Wl,-rpath,/opt/suse/lib64</strong></span>
            </p><p>or on 32-bit systems:</p><p>
                <span class="command"><strong>-Wl,-rpath,/opt/suse/lib</strong></span>
            </p><p>This causes both the application and libraries that are built to look for the
                libraries in <code class="filename">/opt/suse/lib64</code> or
                    <code class="filename">/opt/suse/lib</code> first, and in the regular system locations
                later.</p><p>This can most reliably be done by updating whatever <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">make file</span>”</span> is
                being used to build the software. Note that this must be done for any <span class="strong"><strong>libraries</strong></span> being built, as well as binary executables.
                Having a library pointing to the wrong version will be just as wrong as having the
                program being executed pointing to the wrong version.</p><p>When compiling and linking against OpenSSL 0.9.8, you have a choice; either leave
                the <span class="command"><strong>-Wl,-rpath</strong></span> out entirely, or point to
                    <code class="filename">/usr/lib64</code> or on 32-bit systems
                    <code class="filename">/usr/lib</code>.</p><p>To confirm if your software has been built correctly, execute the following
                command against it:</p><pre class="screen">readelf ­a /path/to/your/binaryorlibrary | grep RUNPATH</pre><p>You should see something similar to this example:</p><pre class="screen">readelf -a /usr/lib/postfix/smtp | grep RUNPATH
0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH)            Library runpath: [/opt/suse/lib64]</pre><p>To confirm if your application is not referencing any of the OpenSSL 0.9.8
                libraries, use the <span class="command"><strong>/usr/bin/ldd</strong></span> command as in this
                example:</p><pre class="screen">ldd /usr/lib/postfix/smtp | grep /libssl.so.0
ldd /usr/lib/postfix/smtp | grep /libcrypto.so.0</pre><p>You should not see any output from either of those commands when run against your
                application files. If you do, it means that your application was linked against the
                wrong version of OpenSSL and you need to re-examine your build processes.</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="sec-appendix"></a>Appendix A</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-checksecmodule"></a>Checking if the Security Module Repository Is Already Defined</h3></div></div></div><p>Issue the following command as the root user: </p><pre class="screen">zypper repos | grep Security</pre><p>If the repository is defined, you should see something similar to this:</p><pre class="screen">17 | nu_novell_com:SLE11-Security-Module | SLE11-Security-Module | No | Yes</pre><p>If it is defined, skip to the section on enabling the Security Module Repository.

  Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St,
  Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and
  distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not
  allowed.
 </p><h5><a id="id1338"></a> 0. PREAMBLE </h5><p>
  The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
  functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure
  everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
  modifying it, either commercially or non-commercially. Secondarily, this
  License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their
  work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by
  others.
 </p><p>
  This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of
  the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the
  GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free
  software.
 </p><p>
  We have designed this License to use it for manuals for free software,
  because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come
  with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this
  License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual
  work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed
  book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
  instruction or reference.
 </p><h5><a id="id1339"></a> 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS </h5><p>
  This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
  under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide,
  royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the
  conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or
  work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You
  accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
  requiring permission under copyright law.
 </p><p>
  A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
  or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
  translated into another language.
 </p><p>
  A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
  Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
  authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
  matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
  subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
  Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be
  a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters,
  or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
  regarding them.
 </p><p>
  The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
  designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
  that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit
  the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as
  Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document
  does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.
 </p><p>
  The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
  Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
  Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5
  words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
 </p><p>
  A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
  represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
  public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with
  generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint
  programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is
  suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a
  variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an
  otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
  been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is
  not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any
  substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
  "Opaque".
 </p><p>
  Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
  without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
  publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or
  PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats
  include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can
  be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
  the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
  machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors
  for output purposes only.
 </p><p>
  The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
  following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
  requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
  any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
  appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
  text.
 </p><p>
  A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title
  either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that
  translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section
  name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
  "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when
  you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ"
  according to this definition.
 </p><p>
  The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states
  that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are
  considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards
  disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers
  may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.
 </p><h5><a id="id1340"></a> 2. VERBATIM COPYING </h5><p>
  You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
  or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and
  the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced
  in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of
  this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
  reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you
  may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large
  enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
 </p><p>
  You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may
  publicly display copies.
 </p><h5><a id="id1341"></a> 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY </h5><p>
  If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed
  covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license
  notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that
  carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the
  front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also
  clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front
  cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
  prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the
  title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as
  verbatim copying in other respects.
 </p><p>
  If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you
  should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
  cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
 </p><p>
  If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
  than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
  with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
  computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
  access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
  Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
  latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
  distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
  copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
  year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through
  your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
 </p><p>
  It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
  Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them
  a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
 </p><h5><a id="id1342"></a> 4. MODIFICATIONS </h5><p>
  You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
  conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
  Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
  role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
  Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
  these things in the Modified Version:
 </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="A"><li class="listitem"><p>
    Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from
    that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
    there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may
    use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that
    version gives permission.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
    together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all
    of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release
    you from this requirement.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,
    as the publisher.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the
    other copyright notices.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving
    the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
    License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and
    required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Include an unaltered copy of this License.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it
    an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
    Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section
    Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
    authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
    an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
    access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
    locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.
    These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network
    location for a work that was published at least four years before the
    Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to
    gives permission.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve the
    Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and
    tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given
    therein.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their
    text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not
    considered part of the section titles.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be
    included in the Modified Version.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to
    conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
   </p></li></ol></div><p>
  If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that
  qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
  Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as
  invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in
  the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any
  other section titles.
 </p><p>
  You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing
  but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,
  statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an
  organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
 </p><p>
  You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
  passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
  Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and
  one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any
  one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
  previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are
  acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
  one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old
  one.
 </p><p>
  The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
  permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
  endorsement of any Modified Version.
 </p><h5><a id="id1343"></a> 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS </h5><p>
  You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
  License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
  provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of
  all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
  Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve
  all their Warranty Disclaimers.
 </p><p>
  The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
  identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are
  multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make
  the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
  parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if
  known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section
  titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
  combined work.
 </p><p>
  In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the
  various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise
  combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled
  "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".
 </p><h5><a id="id1344"></a> 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS </h5><p>
  You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
  released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
  License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the
  collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim
  copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
 </p><p>
  You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
  individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
  into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects
  regarding verbatim copying of that document.
 </p><h5><a id="id1345"></a> 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS </h5><p>
  A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
  independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
  distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from
  the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's
  users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included
  in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the
  aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
 </p><p>
  If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of
  the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
  aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket
  the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if
  the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed
  covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
 </p><h5><a id="id1346"></a> 8. TRANSLATION </h5><p>
  Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
  translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
  Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their
  copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant
  Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
  You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in
  the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
  the original English version of this License and the original versions of
  those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the
  translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
  disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
 </p><p>
  If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
  or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1)
  will typically require changing the actual title.
 </p><h5><a id="id1347"></a> 9. TERMINATION </h5><p>
  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
  expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,
  sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically
  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
  copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 </p><h5><a id="id1348"></a> 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE </h5><p>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
  Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
  similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
  new problems or concerns. See
  <a class="link" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/" target="_top">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.
 </p><p>
  Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the
  Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any
  later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has
  been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
  Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
  any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
