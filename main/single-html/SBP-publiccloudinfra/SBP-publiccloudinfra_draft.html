   of the IT industry. In many cases Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is
   a leading use case of public cloud. The public cloud brings with it a
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">start and use</span>”</span> expectation. This poses a challenge for an
   Enterprise Linux distribution such as SUSE Linux Enterprise to provide access to the
   update repositories without formal registration of the OS
   installation.</p><p>In a traditional data center a SUSE customer will set up a
   new machine (physical or virtual) and configure the system to connect to
   a local SMT server, be managed by SUSE Manager, or connect to the
   SUSE Customer Center (SCC), for SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 based releases, or to the Novell Customer Center
   (NCC), for SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 based releases to obtain updates. In the public
   cloud the data center workflow is not practical.</p><p>Generating registration entitlements for every instance for use
   with SCC/NCC and providing these to the user would not meet the
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">fire up and use</span>”</span> expectation. Automated generation of
   entitlements and injection into instances, while possible, would provide
   registration with SCC/NCC. But it may generate additional cost for the
   customer as packages would need to be downloaded from outside the cloud
   provider`s network for update purposes. Additionally a direct
   registration of instances with SCC/NCC would put the burden of
   verification concerning eligibility into the SCC/NCC code base. For NCC
   this is not possible and for SCC this is undesirable. Therefore, in a
   public cloud setting it is important that the update infrastructure be
   operated inside the public cloud environment.</p><p>This guide describes the setup of the required infrastructure in
   generic terms that scale from small to large cloud installations. The
   implementation of this setup is a requirement to obtain SUSE Certified
   Cloud Provider status. Additionally this setup can also be implemented
   in a private cloud setup.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="sec-overview"></a>High Level Overview</h2></div></div></div><p>The update infrastructure consists of 2 major components:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Region Servers</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>SMT Servers</p></li></ul></div><p>Both run as VMs within the cloud framework. All services run on
   SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP1 or higher. These systems may be
   registered directly to SCC or may be managed using SUSE Manager. In
   addition to having the base repository the systems must also have the
   Public Cloud Module repository configured.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-region-server-s"></a>Region Server(s)</h3></div></div></div><p>The Region Server uses information provided in a configuration
    file, <code class="filename">/etc/regionService/regionData.cfg</code> by
    default, to associate SMT server information with a particular region
    of the cloud framework. If the cloud service offered has only one
    region it is still useful to use the region server to allow for easy
    future expansion. The goal of the overall architecture is to always
    deliver updates for SUSE Linux Enterprise guests region local. In general, IP
    addresses for guests are provided by a DHCP service that is part of the
    cloud framework, and various CIDR blocks are used in various regions.
    This region association of IP addresses, IPv4 and/or IPv6, is part of
    the cloud framework configuration and is captured in the configuration
    file for the region server. For cases where the association of CIDR
    blocks to specific regions is more dynamic the Region Server REST API
    also accepts a <code class="option">regionHint</code> argument that the guest may
    send to obtain information about the SMT servers in the
    guest’s region.</p><p>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server guest instances connect to a Region Server to receive a
    list of SMT Servers available in the region in which the guest instance
    was launched. The information provided to the client is in XML format
    and is sufficient for the client to automatically register with the
    region local SMT Server.</p><p>Generally, multiple Region Server instances should be operated in
    the cloud environment to ensure availability of the Region Service if
    any Region Server is too distant (high latency), down, or otherwise
    unavailable. Information about the Region Servers in the cloud
    framework is encoded in the guest images by including the region
    server’s public certificate in the
     <code class="filename">/var/lib/regionService/certs/</code> directory. The name
    of the certificate files is used to attempt to connect to the Region
    Server via HTTPS.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-smt-server-s"></a>SMT Server(s)</h3></div></div></div><p>The SMT (Subscription Management Tool) Server serves as cache for
    the package repositories obtained from SCC (SUSE Customer Center). The SMT Server
    itself is registered with SCC, or managed via SUSE Manager, as it would
    be in a traditional data center.</p><p>Given the data provided by a Region Server, the client proceeds
    through a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">regular</span>”</span> automated registration process. This
    registration process is identical to the process an administrator in a
    data center would complete when registering a new system against an SMT
    Server operated in a traditional data center.</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="sec-detailed-setup-guide"></a>Detailed Setup Guide</h2></div></div></div><p>Although the Region Server is the first service used by a client,
   its setup and configuration is dependent on the setup of SMT Servers.
   Therefore, the setup guide will describe the setup in reverse order as
   compared to the previous section.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-general-setup"></a>General Setup</h3></div></div></div><p>Before any of the servers are set up and configured some general
    preparations should be completed. Access restriction to the servers is
    a multi-level process as described in more detail later. Generally
    cloud frameworks provide a feature often called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Security
     Groups</span>”</span>. This is a firewalling mechanism that the cloud
    framework network infrastructure provides.</p><p>Use this mechanism to set up two security groups: one used by the
    SMT Servers and one used for the Region Service. The security group
    (firewall rules) for the SMT Server (suggested name: smt-server) needs
    to allow incoming traffic on ports 22, 80, and 443 from all addresses
     (<code class="systemitem">0.0.0.0/0</code>; <code class="systemitem">::/0</code>). All other ports should be
    blocked. The security group (firewall rules) for the Region Service
    (suggested name: region-server) needs to allow incoming traffic on
    ports 22 and 443 from all addresses (<code class="systemitem">0.0.0.0/0</code>; <code class="systemitem">::/0</code>). If you so desire you can move SSH to run on a
    different port and configure your firewall rules accordingly.</p><p>Allocate static IP addresses in the cloud framework. For each
    region there should be at least two SMT Servers. Additionally there
    should be at least two Region Servers. Depending on the footprint of
    the cloud environment more Region Servers, with instances running in
    different regions, may be desired. Thus, allocate at least two static
    IPs per region plus one or more static IPs in each region where a
    Region Server will be set up.</p><p>The final preparatory step is to generate SSH key pairs for the
    servers. Most cloud frameworks provide a way to generate keys or to
    import keys. The SSH key does not need to be built into the image as in
    general it will be injected by the cloud framework on instance launch.
    It is recommended to use different keys for the SMT Server and the
    Region Server.</p><pre class="screen">ssh-keygen -t rsa -f smt
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f regionsrv</pre></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-smt-server-setup"></a>SMT Server Setup</h3></div></div></div><p>The SMT Server is a VM inside the cloud environment. For each
    region at least two SMT Servers should be configured. The number of SMT
    Servers in a region depends on the bandwidth within the data center and
    the number of expected simultaneous users. As a reference, SUSE
    operates two SMT Servers per region in AWS and can satisfy throughput
    needs for registered clients. Thus, it is unlikely that more than two
    SMT Servers are needed in your setup. The setup of an SMT Server inside
    a virtual machine is no different than the setup of an SMT Server on a
    physical machine. Therefore you can refer to the <a class="link" href="https://documentation.suse.com/sles/12-SP4/html/SLES-all/book-smt.html" target="_top">https://documentation.suse.com/sles/12-SP4/html/SLES-all/book-smt.html</a> SMT documentation for guidance. Alternatively you can build an image
    with kiwi; a template used to build SUSE-operated SMT Servers is
    attached in appendix A.</p><p>The SMT Server functions as a cache for all packages SUSE releases
    as updates for all enabled products. Therefore, it potentially requires
    a large amount of disk space. It is recommended that a 1TB virtual disk
    (or larger) be created inside the cloud environment and attached to the
    SMT Server VM. This storage device will be used to store the
    repositories. In addition it is recommended to store the database on an
    attached virtual disk; a size of 40 GB or more is suggested for the DB
    storage device.</p><p>Having the storage of the repositories on a separate device
    preserves the data should the SMT server VM need to be rebuilt. This
    improves the recovery time since the repositories do not need to be
    repopulated from SCC. Keeping the DB on a separate device ensures that
    the existing registrations do not get lost if the SMT VM needs to be
    rebuilt.</p><p>After the installation of the SMT Server package
     (<span class="emphasis"><em>smt</em></span>) the directory structure required by SMT is
    set up in <code class="filename">/srv/www/htdocs/repo</code>. We want to use
    this directory as the mount point for the external virtual disk that is
    supposed to hold the repositories. The following process outlines the
    steps necessary to set the external device up to hold the
    repositories:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p> In the cloud framework, either via the customary web-UI, or the
      available command line tools create a virtual disk of 1 TB or larger.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p> After the virtual disk creation is complete attach the device
      to the running SMT instance. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p> When the disk is attached log in to the SMT Server as root, or

      recommended file system for this storage device. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p> Copy the content of the SMT directory to a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">safe</span>”</span>

    content must be owned by the <code class="systemitem">smt</code> user and have <code class="systemitem">www</code> group ownership. The procedure for placing the DB
    data onto a separate device is the same.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p> In the cloud framework, either via the customary web-UI, or the

    start-up is cloud framework specific. Thus it depends on the cloud
    framework whether you want to create entries for the mount points in
     <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code>.</p><p>At the protocol level several functions of SMT for the client
    registration use HTTPS, that is these are SSL dependent. Therefore,
    certificate handling is important. In general the assumption is that an
    SMT Server uses a self signed certificate. If you choose to follow the
    path of using a self signed certificate you should use the integrated
    certificate creation step included in the SMT setup process in
    YaST. This process will be followed later after some more
    preliminary settings are complete. However, at your choice you may use
    a certificate signed by a public CA. In this case you need to handle
    certificate placement manually. In cases where SUSE operates an
    infrastructure self signed certificates are used.</p><p>If you choose to use a certificate that is signed by a public CA
    and is thus acceptable by using the known trust chain, it is still
    necessary that the <code class="filename">/srv/www/htdocs/smt.crt</code> file
    exists. This file, in a self signed certificate setup, represents the
    root CA and is imported into the trust chain on the guest that is
    registering with the SMT server. The registration automation downloads
    this file and registration will fail if it does not exist. Thus, even
    for certificates signed by a public CA the root CA must be made
    available via <code class="filename">/srv/www/htdocs/smt.crt</code>.</p><p>The next step for the SMT server configuration is to set up
    registration sharing. Registration sharing is enabled by the
    installation of the <span class="emphasis"><em>smt-ha</em></span> package and is used to
    configure the SMT servers in an active HA configuration. Registration
    sharing can be configured between two or more SMT Servers. The
    certificate setup has an implication on the configuration of
    registration sharing between multiple SMT Servers as well. Registration
    sharing is configured in the SMT configuration file
     <code class="filename">/etc/smt.conf</code>. In the <code class="literal">[LOCAL]</code>
    section add the following configuration entries:</p><pre class="screen">#
# This string is used to verify that any sender trying to share a
# registration is allowed to do so. Provide a comma separated list of
# names or IP addresses.
acceptRegistrationSharing=
#
# This string is used to set the host names and or IP addresses of sibling
# SMT servers to which the registration data should be sent. For multiple
# siblings provide a comma separated list.
shareRegistrations=
#
# This string provides information for SSL verification of the siblings.
# Certificates for the siblings should reside in the given directory.
# If not defined siblings are assumed to have the same CA as this server
siblingCertDir=</pre><p>When a client system registers with the SMT server the SMT
    implementation will send a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">share registration request</span>”</span> to
    all the servers configured with the
     <span class="emphasis"><em>shareRegistrations</em></span> option. The value is a comma
    separated list of IP addresses or host names. Note that the entries
    must match the way the certificate was set up as the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">share
     registration request</span>”</span> is sent to the other SMT server(s) via
    HTTPS. So if you encoded the FQDN of the sibling SMT servers in the
    certificate this name must be used as a value of the
     <span class="emphasis"><em>shareRegistration</em></span> configuration option. If the
    certificate of the sibling server(s) is not imported into the default
    trust chain you may set the <span class="emphasis"><em>siblingCertDir</em></span> option
    to point the verification code to the directory where the sibling
    server certificates are located.</p><p>When a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">share registration request</span>”</span> is received by an
    SMT Server the list of IP addresses and/or host names (comma separated
    string) provided with the <code class="option">acceptRegistrationSharing</code>
    setting is consulted to verify that the sending system is authorized to
    share a registration. This share request is not propagated to any SMT
    Servers that may be listed in the <code class="option">shareRegistration</code>
    option. Only registration requests received from clients using the
     <span class="command"><strong>suse_register</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>SUSEConnect</strong></span>
    commands are shared with SMT Servers listed with the
     <span class="emphasis"><em>shareRegistrations</em></span> setting.</p><p>Sharing of registration information is important to provide
    failover capabilities for the update infrastructure.</p><p>Before proceeding with the configuration for repository mirroring,
    access control to the SMT server(s) needs to be configured. The SMT
    Server in a public cloud is by definition public, or it could not be
    accessed by the instances of SUSE Linux Enterprise that run within the cloud
    framework. Therefore, access to the SMT Server must be restricted to
    eligible SUSE Linux Enterprise installations. Eligible SUSE Linux Enterprise installations are
    defined to be those for which the cloud provider can account and report
    accurate usage hours to SUSE. The level of access control behind the
    security group setting described earlier (which is considered level 1)
    occurs on two levels:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>HTTP and HTTPS traffic access</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>repository access verification</p></li></ul></div><p>Depending on the offering of SUSE Linux Enterprise in the cloud framework
    repository, access verification may not be necessary.</p><p>Access to the server on the protocol level needs to be restricted
    to IP addresses (IPv4 and/or IPv6) that are handed out by the cloud
    framework DHCP server(s). This process can be automated using the
    utility provided by the <code class="systemitem">python-serviceAccessConfig</code> package. The service provided
    with this package generates ACL information for Apache. More details
    about the configuration of this service are provided in the
     <span class="emphasis"><em>Server Access Control</em></span> section below. You may also
    consult the man page,<code class="literal">man serviceAccessConfig</code> for
    details about the configuration. The file
     <code class="filename">/etc/smt.d/nu_server.conf</code> can be used as a target
    for the ACL generation to control access to the SMT functionality.
    However a higher level Apache file can be used to block access from
    outside IP addresses to Apache altogether.</p><p>If only on-demand images of SUSE Linux Enterprise are offered in the cloud
    framework it is not necessary to implement a repository access
    verification mechanism. However, if BYOS (Bring Your Own Subscription)
    is offered within the cloud framework a repository access mechanism
    needs to be implemented. This is accomplished by adding</p><pre class="screen">#
# This string is used to load a cloud specific verification module to verify
# the guest issuing the registration request is eligible to access the
# repositories. The value none indicates that no verification should
# take place.
cloudGuestVerify=PERL_PLUGIN_NAME</pre><p>to the <code class="filename">/etc/smt.conf</code> file in the
     <code class="literal">[LOCAL]</code> section. The PERL_PLUGIN_NAME in the above
    example is a placeholder for a Perl module that needs to be implemented
    to verify that the guest is eligible to access the repositories. This
    plug-in may perform verification based on accessing a cloud framework
    API or by verifying metadata sent by the guest, or a combination
    thereof.</p><p>The verification module must implement two interfaces,
     <span class="emphasis"><em>verifyGuest</em></span> and
     <span class="emphasis"><em>verifySCCGuest</em></span>. The
     <span class="emphasis"><em>verifyGuest</em></span> implementation is called when a
    client accesses the SMT Server via <span class="emphasis"><em>suse_register</em></span>
    for the first time and the <span class="emphasis"><em>verifySCCGuest</em></span>
    implementation is used when the client uses
     <span class="emphasis"><em>SUSEConnect</em></span> for registration purposes.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>suse_register</em></span> is the implementation shipped
    with SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 to register a SUSE Linux Enterprise installation with NCC (Novell
    Customer Center) or SMT. <span class="command"><strong>SUSEConnect</strong></span> was developed
    to interface with SCC (SUSE Customer Center) and SMT and is shipped with SUSE Linux Enterprise
    12.</p><p>The implementation of the access verification plug-in is placed in
    a file named to match the configuration option, PERL_PLUGIN_NAME.pm for
    the example above, that is placed in the
     <code class="filename">/srv/www/perl-lib/SMT/Client</code> directory. The
    following example shows a stub implementation of the verification

    potentially three levels:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Level 1</span></dt><dd><p>Access control at the cloud framework level, via firewall
       opening ports 22, 80, and 443.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Level 2</span></dt><dd><p>Access control at the protocol level allowing only systems with

       tool.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Level 3</span></dt><dd><p>Repository access verification via SMT plug-in. This is only
       necessary if BYOS images are supported in the cloud
       framework.</p></dd></dl></div><p>The final modifications to the <code class="filename">etc/smt.conf</code>
    file prior to registering SMT with SCC and configuring the repositories
    are to set the authentication and the forwarding information. In
     <code class="filename">etc/smt.conf</code> set the
     <code class="option">forwardRegistration</code> setting to
     <code class="literal">false</code> and set the <code class="option">requiredAuthType</code>
    to <code class="literal">lazy</code>.</p><p>You are now ready to complete the higher level SMT setup and
    eventually synchronize the repository content from SCC. Use YaST
    to configure the remaining settings of SMT following the SMT setup
    documentation. As part of this process, if you are using a self signed
    certificate, the certificate creation workflow can be invoked.</p><p>The final step is to set up the repositories that should be
    mirrored. This can be completed with YaST or the
     <span class="command"><strong>smt-repos</strong></span> command. Mirror the repositories
     <code class="literal">Pool</code>, and <code class="literal">Update</code> for the base
    distributions SLES 11 and SLES 12, as well as the
     <code class="literal">Debuginfo</code> and <code class="literal">SDK</code> repositories.
    In addition both SLES 11 and SLES 12 offer specific module repositories
    that are considered to be part of SLES but are delivered as separate
    repositories. These should also be enabled for mirroring.</p><p>You only need to mirror the repositories for the architecture of
    interest to you. In most cases this will be only x86_64. There is
    generally no advantage in a cloud environment to run 32-bit instances
    as the underlying hardware is generally 64-bit capable and 64-bit
    instances are fully capable of running 32-bit applications. If you need
    to mirror more than one architecture you may need to increase the size
    of the storage that holds the packages.</p><p>The final step in the SMT setup is to mirror the repositories from
    SCC using the <span class="emphasis"><em>smt-mirror</em></span> command as root. This
    will download all the packages for the configured repositories and
    takes some time. Usually the synchronization will complete
    overnight.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-smt-server-monitoring"></a>SMT Server Monitoring</h3></div></div></div><p>The SMT servers should be monitored for health status. In addition

    the SMT Servers in a given region to the connecting guest. The Region
    Server runs as a Python script using the Flask framework in Apache. The
    Region Server is provided with the
     <code class="systemitem">cloud-regionsrv</code> package. As with the SMT
    server the region server should be access restricted to the IP address
    ranges for the cloud framework. More on this access control in the
    section <a class="xref" href="#sec-server-access-control" title="Server Access Control">the section called “Server Access Control”</a>.</p><p>The service itself uses two configuration files: one file,
     <code class="filename">/etc/regionService/regionInfo.cfg</code> is used to
    configure the service, the other,
     <code class="filename">/etc/regionService/regionData.cfg</code> provides the
    data the Region Server will provide to the connecting client; both
    files are in the ini format.</p><p>The <code class="filename">regionInfo.cfg</code> file is used to configure
    the location of the log file and the location of the
     <code class="filename">regionData.cfg</code> file with the
     <code class="option">logFile</code> and <code class="option">regionConfig</code> options,
    respectively. The default settings for the configuration file are shown
    below and should suffice for most installations.</p><pre class="screen">[server]
logFile = /var/log/regionService/regionInfo.log
regionConfig = /etc/regionService/regionData.cfg</pre><p>The default <code class="filename">regionData.cfg</code> file provides a
    template for the configuration file. This file can be maintained
    manually or be auto-generated, depending on your setup for IP address
    allocation within your cloud framework. The
     <code class="filename">regionData.cfg</code> file needs to contain one
    configuration section per region. Often regions in a given cloud setup
    are named by geographic location, such as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">us-east-1</span>”</span> for
    the Amazon cloud setup in the eastern geography of the United States.
    This location indicator is also often available through querying of
    metadata in the guest image. It is therefore recommended that the
    section name in the <code class="filename">regionData.cfg</code> file match the
    names of the region names available through the metadata of the
    framework. In cases where IP addresses are not stable in their
    association with regions the region metadata can be queried in the
    guest and passed to the Region Server as a hint to obtain the SMT
    Server information for the given region. The hint is processed with
    string matching and thus having section names match the configured
    region names is important. The server implementation has no option of
    name mapping. For each region all options in the section must be
    configured.</p><p>The section options are as follows:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"> public-ips </span></dt><dd><p> The value for this option is a comma separated list of IP
       ranges in CIDR format, for example: </p><pre class="screen">public-ips = 62.135.16.0/18,56.56.130.0/16</pre><p>These are the ranges the DHCP server in the given region is
       configured to use. If the access configuration utility
        <span class="command"><strong>python-serviceAccessConfig</strong></span> is used and pointed

       generate the ACL.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"> smt-server-ip </span></dt><dd><p> The value for this option is a comma separated list of the SMT
       Server IP addresses in the region being configured. </p></dd><dt><span class="term"> smt-server-name </span></dt><dd><p> The value for this option sets the host name of the SMT Server
       that was encoded into the certificate during the setup of the SMT
       Server. If only one value is supplied it will be used for all IP
       addresses provided by the <code class="option">smt-server-ip</code> setting. If
       more than one value is supplied the number of names must match the
       number of IP addresses given with the <code class="option">smt-server-ip</code>
       option. The order of the names and IP addresses must match as well.
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term"> smt-fingerprint </span></dt><dd><p> The value for this option is the fingerprint of the root CA
       created during the SMT Server setup. On the SMT Server, the
        <code class="filename">/srv/www/htdocs</code> includes the

       to the client and verified prior to accepting the repositories from

       each server has its own CA supply a comma separated list. The order
       must match the order of the IP addresses or certificate acceptance
       will fail and the guest cannot register with the SMT Server.</p></dd></dl></div><p>The following shows an example of a completed section for a region
    in a cloud setup.</p><pre class="screen">[nor-north]
public-ips = 62.135.16.0/18,56.56.130.0/16

    If this were not the case another value for the
     <code class="option">smt-server-name</code> and for the
     <code class="option">smt-fingerprint</code> options would need to be
    configured.</p><pre class="screen">[mid-north]
public-ips = 62.135.16.0/18,56.56.130.0/16
smt-server-ip = 62.153.16.20,56.56.130.253
smt-server-name = smt-mid-a.supertuxcloud.com, smt-mid-b.supertuxcloud.com

    different names. The certificate in this case would contain a wild
    card.</p><p>The Region Server reads the <code class="filename">regionData.cfg</code>
    file as configured in the <code class="filename">regionInfo.cfg</code> file at
    start-up and creates a hash table from the information provided in the
     <code class="filename">regionData.cfg</code> file. Depending on the number of
    IP address ranges this may result in a relatively large requirement of
    memory. For estimation purposes one can use a requirement of 20 MB per
    octet (254 IP addresses). The Region Server also creates a secondary
    hash table that relates the region names to the SMT Server information.
    The secondary hash table is consulted if the Region Server receives a
    region hint from the client.</p><p>The Region Server provides the <code class="option">regionInfo</code> REST
    API, that is to obtain SMT information the client image will access the
    Region Server via: <a class="link" href="https://IP_ADDRESS_OF_REGION_SERVER/regionInfo" target="_top">https://IP_ADDRESS_OF_REGION_SERVER/regionInfo</a>
   </p><p>The knowledge of the IP addresses of the Region Servers and the
    certificates for the Region Servers are built into the guest image. It
    is recommended to create a package for the Region Service client; for
    more details see the section concerning the guest image.</p><p>As mentioned previously, for environments where the IP address
    assignment per region is not stable or accessible via API the option
    exists to let the client pass a region hint to the Region Server. If
    the region hint is passed the Region Server will first try to provide
    SMT information to the client based on the region name given in the
    hint. If this fails the Region Server will fall back to using the IP
    address. A request using the region hint option provides the region
    hint as an argument with the URL: <a class="link" href="https://IP_ADDRESS_OF_REGION_SERVER/regionInfo?regionHint=REGION_NAME" target="_top">https://IP_ADDRESS_OF_REGION_SERVER/regionInfo?regionHint=REGION_NAME</a>
   </p><p>In this case <span class="emphasis"><em>REGION_NAME</em></span> must match a name of
    one of the sections in the <code class="filename">regionData.cfg</code> file as
    indicated previously.</p><p>Instead of using IP addresses directly for the Region Servers in
    the client it is also possible to use name resolution via DNS. One
    potential advantage of using DNS for the Region Server is that no new
    package would need to be released if a Region Server needs to move out
    of a given region and into a new region where a new IP address would
    need to be allocated. However, this implies that an entire cloud region
    would be shut down, which is a very unlikely scenario. The Region
    Server package (<code class="systemitem">cloud-regionsrv</code>) provides a
    convenient executable to generate the server certificate. After the
    region server instance is booted run:</p><pre class="screen">genRegionServerCert -c COUNTRY -d DEPARTMENT --host IP_ADDRESS_OR_HOSTNAME -l LOCATION -o ORGANIZATION -s STATE</pre><p>This will generate the server certificate and place the public
    cert into <code class="filename">/root/regionServCert/</code> . This certificate
    needs to be included in the SUSE Linux Enterprise guest image. The details about
    the Region Server certificate are described in the guest image creation
    section. The cert generation script will restart the Apache Web
    server.</p><p>With the configuration in place and the certificate generated the
    Region Server setup is complete.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-region-server-monitoring"></a>Region Server Monitoring</h3></div></div></div><p>The Region servers should be monitored for health status. In

    have ACL level control to allow access to the services only from the IP
    ranges that are used by the DHCP servers of the cloud framework. This
    configuration can be set up manually or it can be automated using the
     <code class="systemitem">python-serviceAccessConfig</code> tool.</p><p>For both the SMT server and the Region Server, access control has
    two layers: the firewall rule and the ACL rules as described earlier.
    The SMT server may also implement a third layer. The
     <code class="systemitem">python-serviceAccessConfig</code> generates ACL
    rules for Apache and can be pointed to the
     <code class="literal">regionData.cfg</code> file to collect all the public IP
    addresses used by the cloud framework. This set of CIDR blocks is used
    to generate the access control rules for Apache. Therefore, it is
    recommended that the same
     <code class="filename">/etc/regionService/regionData.cfg</code> exist on SMT
    and Region servers.</p><p>The <code class="option">serviceAccessConfig</code> process monitors the
     <code class="filename">/etc/regionServer/regionData.cfg</code> file and
    generates new access rules when changes are detected. It is therefore
    possible to fully automate the access rule generation by implementing a
    generator for <code class="filename">regionData.cfg</code> that may parse the
    DHCP rules and then push out a new file to all servers when the rules
    change, for example.</p><p>The <code class="option">serviceAccessConfig</code> process is configured
    with the <code class="filename">/etc/cloudServiceAccess/srvAccess.cfg</code>
    configuration file; consult the man page for detailed
    information.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="sec-guest-image"></a>Guest Image</h3></div></div></div><p>The content of the guest image, that is the image that provides
    the basis for the instances CSP customers use is customizable to the
    desires of the cloud framework provider.</p><p>For an image to be considered supportable the image must have at
    least the so-called <code class="systemitem">Minimal Pattern</code> installed.
    In addition to this a cloud image generally requires some
    initialization code that handles SSH key injection, account creation,
    and other housekeeping tasks. This initialization code can be
     <span class="emphasis"><em>cloud-init</em></span>, an open source solution found in the
    Public Cloud Module repository, or some other initialization
    implementation.</p><p>The package <code class="systemitem">cloud-regionsrv-client</code>
    provides the necessary executable to handle automated guest image
    registration with the update infrastructure. The client code is
    configured with the <code class="filename">/etc/regionserverclnt.cfg</code>

    implement the <code class="literal">generateRegionSrvArgs</code> function. No
    arguments are passed to the function and the return value is expected
    to be a string that will match a section in the
     <code class="filename">regionData.cfg</code> file. The return value of the
     <code class="literal">generateRegionSrvArgs</code> is expected to be a string
    and provides the value for the <code class="option">regionHint</code> argument the

    dictated by the hypervisor used by the cloud framework. <a class="link" href="https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/kiwi/doc/" target="_top">KIWI</a>,
    the open source, SUSE sponsored image build tool can produce images in
    almost any format required by the known hypervisors. KIWI can also

  Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St,
  Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and
  distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not
  allowed.
 </p><h5><a id="id1776"></a> 0. PREAMBLE </h5><p>
  The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
  functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure
  everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
  modifying it, either commercially or non-commercially. Secondarily, this
  License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their
  work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by
  others.
 </p><p>
  This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of
  the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the
  GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free
  software.
 </p><p>
  We have designed this License to use it for manuals for free software,
  because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come
  with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this
  License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual
  work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed
  book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
  instruction or reference.
 </p><h5><a id="id1780"></a> 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS </h5><p>
  This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
  under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide,
  royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the
  conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or
  work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You
  accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
  requiring permission under copyright law.
 </p><p>
  A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
  or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
  translated into another language.
 </p><p>
  A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
  Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
  authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
  matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
  subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
  Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be
  a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters,
  or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
  regarding them.
 </p><p>
  The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
  designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
  that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit
  the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as
  Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document
  does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.
 </p><p>
  The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
  Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
  Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5
  words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
 </p><p>
  A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
  represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
  public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with
  generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint
  programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is
  suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a
  variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an
  otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
  been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is
  not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any
  substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
  "Opaque".
 </p><p>
  Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
  without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
  publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or
  PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats
  include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can
  be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
  the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
  machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors
  for output purposes only.
 </p><p>
  The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
  following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
  requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
  any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
  appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
  text.
 </p><p>
  A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title
  either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that
  translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section
  name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
  "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when
  you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ"
  according to this definition.
 </p><p>
  The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states
  that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are
  considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards
  disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers
  may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.
 </p><h5><a id="id1791"></a> 2. VERBATIM COPYING </h5><p>
  You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
  or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and
  the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced
  in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of
  this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
  reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you
  may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large
  enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
 </p><p>
  You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may
  publicly display copies.
 </p><h5><a id="id1794"></a> 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY </h5><p>
  If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed
  covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license
  notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that
  carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the
  front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also
  clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front
  cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
  prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the
  title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as
  verbatim copying in other respects.
 </p><p>
  If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you
  should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
  cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
 </p><p>
  If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
  than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
  with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
  computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
  access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
  Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
  latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
  distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
  copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
  year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through
  your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
 </p><p>
  It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
  Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them
  a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
 </p><h5><a id="id1799"></a> 4. MODIFICATIONS </h5><p>
  You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
  conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
  Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
  role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
  Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
  these things in the Modified Version:
 </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="A"><li class="listitem"><p>
    Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from
    that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
    there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may
    use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that
    version gives permission.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
    together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all
    of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release
    you from this requirement.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,
    as the publisher.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the
    other copyright notices.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving
    the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
    License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and
    required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Include an unaltered copy of this License.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it
    an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
    Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section
    Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
    authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
    an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
    access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
    locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.
    These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network
    location for a work that was published at least four years before the
    Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to
    gives permission.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve the
    Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and
    tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given
    therein.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their
    text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not
    considered part of the section titles.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be
    included in the Modified Version.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to
    conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
   </p></li></ol></div><p>
  If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that
  qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
  Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as
  invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in
  the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any
  other section titles.
 </p><p>
  You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing
  but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,
  statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an
  organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
 </p><p>
  You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
  passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
  Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and
  one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any
  one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
  previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are
  acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
  one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old
  one.
 </p><p>
  The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
  permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
  endorsement of any Modified Version.
 </p><h5><a id="id1836"></a> 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS </h5><p>
  You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
  License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
  provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of
  all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
  Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve
  all their Warranty Disclaimers.
 </p><p>
  The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
  identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are
  multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make
  the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
  parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if
  known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section
  titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
  combined work.
 </p><p>
  In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the
  various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise
  combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled
  "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".
 </p><h5><a id="id1840"></a> 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS </h5><p>
  You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
  released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
  License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the
  collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim
  copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
 </p><p>
  You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
  individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
  into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects
  regarding verbatim copying of that document.
 </p><h5><a id="id1843"></a> 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS </h5><p>
  A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
  independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
  distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from
  the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's
  users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included
  in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the
  aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
 </p><p>
  If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of
  the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
  aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket
  the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if
  the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed
  covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
 </p><h5><a id="id1846"></a> 8. TRANSLATION </h5><p>
  Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
  translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
  Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their
  copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant
  Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
  You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in
  the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
  the original English version of this License and the original versions of
  those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the
  translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
  disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
 </p><p>
  If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
  or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1)
  will typically require changing the actual title.
 </p><h5><a id="id1849"></a> 9. TERMINATION </h5><p>
  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
  expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,
  sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically
  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
  copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 </p><h5><a id="id1851"></a> 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE </h5><p>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
  Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
  similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
  new problems or concerns. See
  <a class="link" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/" target="_top">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.
 </p><p>
  Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the
  Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any
  later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has
  been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
  Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
  any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
